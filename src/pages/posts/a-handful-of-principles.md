We live in lawless times. The rule of law strains under aggressive ignorance and cynicism. As individuals there's not much we can do to turn the national tide but we can find purpose and strength in principles.

Principles are words we live by. Living by our words means believing that language has meaning and that virtuous action rooted in rational thought leads to a better life for individuals and communities.

Here are some words I choose to live by.

## Read, write, and share your way out of ignorance and fear

I've only found one reliable way to come to grips with ignorance and fear: read, take notes, refine your notes into something you can share, and then share. It's a virtuous cycle: others' writing becomes your reading, your writing becomes others' reading. *Ad infinitum.* Prize wisdom above all else.

## Respect people enough to disagree with them openly

This is a new one for me personally. Netflix's culture of open feedback has brought it out of me. If you disagree with someone's thoughts or actions, tell them. It may seem confrontational but really you're affirming your faith in the value of conversation and in people's ability to grow. What's even more confrontational is *not* talking to someone about what's bothering you. By remaining silent you're implicitly saying, "We are fundamentally different. You're incapable of understanding me but I can see right through you. There is no hope that the rift between us can be healed." I refuse to believe that any such fundamental difference between people is possible. There is always hope.

## Listen to your heart

This sounds sappy but it's a solid principle for both moral and creative decision making. It demands that you find the courage to seek quiet and open yourself to the anxieties, fears, passions, and dreams that speak in that void. The hardest thing to do when listening to your heart is refrain from rushing in with solutions and plans. Just be receptive. Acknowledge what's in you and accept it for what it is. Listen first, then take action.
