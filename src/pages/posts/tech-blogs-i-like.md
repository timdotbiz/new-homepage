[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) is all about fundamentals: the command line, networking, career advice (i.e. the other networking). She's a thoughtful and entertaining writer and her massive back catalog of posts is worth reading through. She also sells her awesome zines over at [Wizard Zines](https://wizardzines.com/).

[Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/) writes great tutorials. The thing I like most is she's thorough and no-nonsense. All the techbros writing their first-and-only-ever posts on Medium should study Tania's writing. Here's a good one to start with: [How to Connect to an API with JavaScript](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript/).

[Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/) is a little more free-ranging on topics but I like the way he thinks about the web and web development. Here's a recent post I really liked: [Tradeoffs and Shifting Complexity](https://daverupert.com/2020/06/tradeoffs-and-shifting-complexity/) in which he share's Larry Tesler's words that are worth their fontweight in gold:

>Every application must have an inherent amount of irreducible complexity. The only question is who will have to deal with it.

Honorable mentions for blogs that are no longer actively maintained: [Pony Foo](https://ponyfoo.com/) and [The New Code](http://thenewcode.com/).
