\> Gratitude is not a passive response to something we have been given, gratitude arises from paying attention, from being awake in the presence of everything that lives within and without us. Gratitude is not necessarily something that is shown after the event, it is the deep, *a priori* state of attention that shows we understand and are equal to the gifted nature of life.

This is from David Whyte's essay collection, [Consolations: The Solace, Nourishment and Underlying Meaning of Everyday Words](https://davidwhyte.stores.yahoo.net/cop.html). I've been making more of an effort to actively practice gratitude at work, and the experience has taught me that Whyte is correct in finding a connection between gratitude and paying attention.

A coworker helped me out of a jam and I wrote them a short message to say thank you. He replied there was nothing to thank him for. Anybody could have done it. I could let his comment go by unanswered but instead I wrote back and contradicted him. Sure, any similarly qualified person could have done it, but they didn't. He did.

Why did I feel the need to push on this? Why not just let my coworker step out of the conversation with a self-deprecating comment? Self-deprecation is a common rhetorical gesture; just let it go by unremarked, like someone saying "How's it going" *sans* question mark. 

Here's why.

I myself have a hard time accepting gratitude or praise, and I remember vividly those occasions when someone has convinced me that their gratitude is genuine. Accepting thanks and praise makes us vulnerable. If someone has a positive opinion of me and I accept that their opinion is valid, I open myself up to the risk that they may someday have a valid negative opinion of me. As someone expressing gratitude, you have to break through people's fear of being known and your own fear of being known as you express your feelings.

Another challenge inherent in giving thanks: we have to acknowledge that the good we do others is part of the good of life as a whole, which means acknowledging that we're each individually just part of the supporting cast in someone else's story. In giving thanks we participate in what White calls "the gifted nature of life," and all participation pushes against the boundaries of our identity in a way that is both thrilling and scary.
