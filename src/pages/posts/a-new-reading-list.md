Been reading a bit more lately. Crashed through *The Vintage Book of Contemporary American Poetry*. (Somebody left it in the freebies pile in the lobby of our last apartment in Boston. Ah, Boston -- I miss its bookishness.) Also have been keeping up with this year's issues of Poetry magazine. My dad got me a couple collections of poetry for my birthday; have been enjoying those. And I keep coming back to my favorite anthology, Robert Pinsky's *Singing School*.

So: a new reading list. Anthologies and magazines are great for getting a cursory sense of a bunch of authors so you can gather a list of names to dig into. Here's mine in no particular order:

John Berryman  
J.V. Cunningham  
Jean Garrigue  
May Swenson  
Robert Duncan  
William Meredith  
Howard Nemerov  
Edgar Bowers  
W.D. Snodgrass  
Galway Kinnell  
Irving Feldman  
Robert Pinsky  
Sharon Olds  
Kay Ryan  
Henri Cole  
Rae Armantrout  
Max Ritvo  
Mary Karr  
Peter Cole  
sam sax  
Mary Oliver  
Adam Zagajewski  
Rolf Jacobsen  
Valery Larbaud  
Edward Field  
Wang Wei  
James Applewhite  
Kenneth Rexroth  
Tu Fu  
Zbigniew Herbert  
Raymond Carver  
Linda Gregg  
Constantine Cavafy  
Rainer Maria Rilke  
Anna Swir  
James Tate  
Wislawa Szymborska  
Anna Kamienska  
Stevie Smith  
Thom Gunn  

I'm more inclined to start by digging into the lesser knowns -- less known to me at least. Maybe start with Stevie Smith? Or W.D. Snodgrass? I'm kind of fascinated by Max Ritvo. He and I were studying at Yale at the same time, and though I'm sure we never met before his death I'm also sure there's no way we didn't cross paths, maybe attended the same readings or lectures. I'm not certain what to do, but I'm excited to be beginning again.
