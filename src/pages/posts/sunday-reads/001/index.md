Mariko Kosaka wrote [an amazing 4-part series](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/09/inside-browser-part1) about how browser's work, chock-full of helpful illustrations. If you've ever wondered about the gritty details of how your web browser is able to turn all those 0s and 1s into text and images, you have to give this series a look.

Along similar lines, over at CSS-Tricks the always eloquent Rachel Nabors published [The Ecological Impact of Browser Diversity](https://css-tricks.com/the-ecological-impact-of-browser-diversity/). A lot of developers see a wide-variety of browsers as some sort of plague ("Argh, why do I have to support all these browsers?") but actually some competition in the browser marketplace is healthy and better for everyone in the long run.

For React devs, be sure to read the React team's [guide to optimizing performance](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html). It's a great way to step up your game and includes links to a variety of helpful libraries and tutorials.

I generally avoid acronyms at work â€” their exclusionary, easy to mix up, unfriendly to dyslexics, the list goes on. Over on Twitter, Dan Abaramov [threw some shade at the "Stateless Functional Components" SFC acronym](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1039988458738073601). After all, SFC could just as well stand for "State*ful* Functional Components". It's easy to confuse concision with precision.

Bob "Clean Code" Martin wrote this Platonic dialogue on [unit test contra-variance](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/10/03/TestContravariance.html) late last year and I'm still digesting its implications. The immediate upshot, however, is that I'm looking at unit tests from a completely different angle than I used to. Any unit test that too closely mirrors the code it's testing is ripe for a refactor.
