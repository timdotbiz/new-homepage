Imagine you have a box of random car parts. They're all high quality and in perfect condition, and you know that if you put them together they'll make a functioning car. But you don't have any guidance on how the parts are meant to fit together or what they're supposed to accomplish once they're assembled.

This is just like test-driven development (TDD) without behavior-driven development (BDD). Practicing strict TDD increases your odds of writing functions flexible enough to withstand change while accomplishing their specific purpose, but it can't answer basic questions like whether the whole application is meeting the needs of the business and the users.

In my experience, engineers have strong opinions about TDD. They're either vehemently against it or religiously for it. I've slowly made my way toward faith in TDD. But BDD? This is largely the domain of QA engineers.
