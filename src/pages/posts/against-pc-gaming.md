title: Why I Don't Play PC Games

I need to hear this and maybe someone else does too, so here goes:

Sometimes I'll get hooked by the temptation to pour some serious money and time into PC gaming. I played PC games a lot as a kid; maybe I'm just feeling exhausted and trying to rekindle some of that enthusiasm. Or maybe PC gaming just seems somehow more "grown up" than playing Nintendo Switch.

Don't do it, Timmy. Beware!

Thanks to game demos on platforms like Steam I can easily try out PC games and remember why it's just not for me.

- I play games in short sessions. (The exception being Stardew Valley.) I only have patience for about 20 minutes worth of gaming before I want to move onto something else.
- I play games to get away from the computer. I make my living online, so playing games on a computer just feels like work to me.
- I like to play handheld with family around. Just because I'm taking so me-time doesn't mean I have to be isolated.
- I like action, fighting, racing, and sports games. (The exception being Stardew Valley.) When I was younger I wanted the immersive RPG and strategy experiences a PC excels out but now that just sounds boring.

People grow up. Our tastes change. This is one of my changes.
