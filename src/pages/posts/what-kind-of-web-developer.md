subtitle: Taking stock of where I am and where I'm headed in my career

This past week I attended the 2019 [React Rally](https://www.reactrally.com/) in Salt Lake City, and now I'm enjoying my first vacation since starting at Netflix 11 months ago. It's a good opportunity for reflection, to think about what kind of web developer I want to be.

## The Question

In my career as a web developer, should I dig deeper into the areas I already know or should I expand my knowledge out to other areas so Iâ€™m more well balanced?

A well-rounded web developer would know about everything from how the computer's CPUs and memory work to the inner machinations of the operating system to the fine grained details of TCP/IP to all the latest developments in CSS and JavaScript and which browsers they work on to the fundamentals of web design and the physiology and psychology of human perception.

But for almost all people holding down a job and multiple other responsibilities, that combination of deep and broad knowledge is impossible. Looking at the practical experience I've gained over the years, most of my knowledge of Node, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks, HTTP, and the fundamentals of web design. In the aggregate, my whole career has been focused toward web browsers.

## The Answer

Putting aside pride and curiosity and vanity and fear of being called out as an impostor, the course forward is simple: I need to dig deeper into the areas I already know. Career opportunities and job satisfaction come from doing deep work and acquiring expertise.

My areas of expertise, can be abstracted into these four fundamental categories:

* **The Assets** - Everything that needs to be sent to the browser.
* **The Wire** - How the assets are sent to the browser.
* **The Browser** - How the browser renders the assets that have been sent.
* **The Experience** - How the user sees and interacts with what the browser has rendered.

As with any abstraction, I'm limiting the scope of my knowledge so I can master my proscribed area. But there is joy in knowing one's limits; it's the joy of self-knowledge, the joy of motivation, the joy of ownership. As someone who takes his responsibilities seriously, it's the joy of knowing I'll be ready to meet whatever challenges come.
