subtitle: On how the right equipment frees our whole person

This year I made three big music-related purchases and ended up returning two of them. I can say that I was genuinely surprised by how much I disliked these two items, each of which I'd researched and considered for months before hitting the "Buy Now" button.

The first item I returned was a digital modeling amplifier, the Fender Mustang GT40. I already own a Fender tube amplifier, the Fender Hot Rod Deluxe, but it's way too powerful for playing at home and I don't have any effects pedals. So rather than start down the long and expensive path of building a pedal board I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone and buy a soft-voiced practice amp with all the effects you could want just built in.

The problem was that it sounded like something was missing from the sound. No matter how loud I turned it up or how I adjusted the settings, it felt like I'd play my guitar and then the amplifier would do a bad impression of what I'd meant to play. Technically, it probably just was that the bass was weak. You can only get so much out of an single speaker in a tiny cabinet that barely resonates. But it felt more significant than that. It felt like I was playing the guitar, but I wasn't playing music.

The second item I returned was an Akai Fire controller for Fruity Loops Studio was similar. I got the thing and it was beautiful and I plugged it in and installed the software and played it and played it and it just didn't connect with me. I stayed up late one night determined to figure out how to make not just sounds but actual honest-to-God music with this thing, but I just couldn't. I would imagine what I wanted to hear but the machine kept me from playing it. I had the same feeling as with the amplifier: I'm playing the instrument but what comes back from the speaker doesn't really have anything to do with me.

In both cases what was missing was a physical connection between my imagination and the machine. When I'm at a piano or a guitar my fingers just know where to go. It's one of the gifts that comes playing and studying these instruments for 20+ years. You just start to know the physical dimensions of the instrument to such a degree that you can close your eyes and feel you way toward the notes. Something about the size of the buttons on the Fire kept me making that connection, and though I know I could eventually develop a greater familiarity with it if I kept it around, I also know that that's not a journey I'm willing to start at the age of 34.

Contrast those experiences with when I found my new Fender Stratocaster, my third purchase this year. I knew I wanted a new guitar (my 10-year old jazz guitar just wasn't doing it for me anymore), so I started shopping with a budget of \$1,000. I played probably fifty guitars, some a fraction of my budge, others double or even triple what I meant to pay. I soon learned that the cost, the reputation, and the look have nothing to do with whether or not a guitar is good. The only thing that matters is how it feels: whether your hands are the right size for it, whether it's too heavy or too light, whether the frets are the right height, whether it smells good, whether it sits well against your stomach or across your knee.

It's all about your particular body and that particular guitar. Any other consideration is nonsense.

That's how I found my \$600 Mexican-made Strat. The instant I played it I knew I could imagine and explore through this guitar. My body was so instantly connected with it, I could trust that it would never say one thing when I'd meant to say another. The feeling: freedom.

I'm gonna smash together some quotes from Robert Pinsky's essay ["Freedom in Poetry"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/70036/freedom-in-poetry):

> "There are no rules. Or, you can modify that rule by observing that each work of art generates its own unique rules. Impulses, swerves, collisions, flights, descents, gags, indirections, surprises, exploding cigars, non sequiturs: all are allowed or encouraged, and all in some sense begin to create their own principles."

Creative expression is an exercise in freedom. Our whole mental, physical, and spiritual person is involved in the act of imagining and expressing who we are and what we believe. The right instrument helps us venture into the unknown but also helps us come back to the realm of the intelligible. In other words, it gives our passions form.

> "There are no rules."

But in the act of creation we dream up principles, which are better than rules, because they're ours.
