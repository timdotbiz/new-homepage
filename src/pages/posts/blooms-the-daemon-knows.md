Today the Ploughshares Blog published [my brief essay](http://blog.pshares.org/index.php/harold-blooms-song-of-self/) on Harold Bloom's new book, *The Daemon Knows*. I feel pretty happy about it, but I know it could be a lot better. I know that some day I'll be happy with my writing because I know that I'm becoming happier with my writing, yet there's still such a long way to go. There's nothing I can do about this shitty feeling — except write!
