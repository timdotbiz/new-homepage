This year I [only have one goal](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-one-habit-a-year-to-a-better-man/): get better at scheduling. In January I discovered that I prefer physical calendars and goal tracking systems (like [Kanban boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)) to digital apps.

In February I made a second discovery: making my goals small enough to fit into a single day.

I could have a goal to read twelve books this year, but that's not something I can make any trackable progress on in a day. But if I make it a goal to read 20 pages a day then I can easily accomplish that every single day. The same goes for doing pushups, doing chores around the house, working on a side project.

This shifts my attention from huge and scary achievements to small and healthy behaviors. Sure it's fun sometimes to look to what I will have achieved if I keep up a certain behavior (if I stay focused I'll have done over 10,000 pushups and situps and run 150 miles!) but it's actually better not to. [Don't look down.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontLookDown)

Relieving myself of Big Goal anxiety makes it easier to schedule little pockets of time for healthy behaviors in between the big chunks of time devoted to family and work. On the whole it's a better balance of what I owe others and what I owe myself.
