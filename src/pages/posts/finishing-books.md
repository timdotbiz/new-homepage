Lately I've been having trouble finishing books. I start a lot of books because I'm a curious person and my slow-paced, quiet-loving temperament is well suited to engaging with books. Sometimes I'll go years finishing a couple books every week, but now there's something in the air that keeps me from seeing books through to the end.

One of the few I've finished in 2020 was Alan Jacobs' *The Pleasures of Reading in an Age of Distraction*. Jacobs posits, with some supporting anecdotes and brain science, that the Internet is to blame. My case isn't unique; our growing preference for hypertext comes at the expense of our brain's ability to concentrate on text. 

I want to break out of this rut for a couple reasons. I get a lot of pleasure and a sense of accomlishment out of reading books, and I want those feelings back. Equally selfishly, as I've read in Cal Newport's *Deep Work*, being able to concentrate and do serious reading gives a unique competitive advantage in this new world of alliterate adults.

So I'm doing something of an exercise regimen. I've slowly weened myself off of Facebook and Twitter and have seen that I am, generally, able to do more reading. This was a scary move, actually. I don't want to become uninformed or push off the emotional labor of managing friendships onto others. But leaving these social media behind has been really good for my mood, my creativity, and my reading time.

But while that's increased the quantity I read it hasn't done much for the quality of attention I bring to my reading. I'm also reading 10 pages a day of some heavy book that hardly anybody would ever read for pleasure.

I'm starting with Thucydides' *History of the Peloponessian War*. I majored in classical languages back at Fresno State but only ever read Thucydides in bits and pieces. Going through it a little at a time, giving myself time to look at maps, take notes, and have conversations about it with my wife (who is a historian) has given me a new appreciation for the book. 

In my creative work I believe in a couple principles. Start with what you have. Do more with less. Value depth over breadth. It never occurred to me to treat reading as a creative act that can harness these same principles, but trying this approach now it makes perfect sense.
