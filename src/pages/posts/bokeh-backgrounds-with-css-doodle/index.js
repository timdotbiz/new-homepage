      <p>I‚Äôve been obsessing over this ultra-cool <a href="https://css-doodle.com/" target="blank"><code>&lt;css-doodle /&gt;</code></a> web component. It makes it so easy to generate fun and beautiful graphics for websites. I was playing around with one of the samples <a href="https://css-doodle.com/#usage" target="blank">in the docs</a> and came up with this cool pattern for creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh" target="_blank">bokeh</a> background. I‚Äôll walk you through it üòÉ The final product will look like this:</p>
      <CodePen uid='qYeQBX' title='Bokeh Background with CSS Doodle' />
      <p>First we add a <code>&lt;css-doodle&gt;</code> component to our html. Throughout the tutorial we‚Äôll add CSS properties inside this component. Using the :doodle selector we divide the doodle into a 12 by 12 grid, stretch it across the whole viewport, and give it a dark blue background color. Just for illustration purposes I‚Äôve added an outline property so you can see the edges of the empty grid cells.</p>
      <CodePen uid='OZKGvW' title='Bokeh Background with CSS Doodle - Step 1' />
      <p>Let‚Äôs start filling our grid cells. We‚Äôre going to replace our outline property with background: hsla(@index(), 70%, 68%, 1); . css-doodle exposes the index of each grid cell (starting from 0) using the @index function. Now each cell will be filled with a solid block of color along the spectrum from red (hue 0) to a turquoise (hue 143, because that‚Äôs the last index in a 12√ó12 grid).</p>
      <CodePen uid='PeMgXp' title='Bokeh Background with CSS Doodle - Step 2' />
      <p>css-doodle exposes a number of cool functions, properties, and selectors to help make coding easier. <a href="https://css-doodle.com/#usage" target="_blank">(Check out their awesome docs for a full list.)</a> We‚Äôll use the @shape selector to fill each grid with a circle instead of a square, and we‚Äôll use the random number generator  function @rand to randomize the opacity of each circle. Now some of circles will really pop while others fade into the background.</p>

      <p><a href="https://css-doodle.com/#property-@shape" target="_blank">(Fun idea: replace ‚Äúcircle‚Äù with another shape from this list.)</a></p>
      <p>Now we‚Äôll add some css transform properties to make things really interesting. First we‚Äôll make the circles smaller or larger at random. We‚Äôll pass @rand two arguments so that it scales down to at least 20% the original size and scales up at most 120% the original size.</p>
      <CodePen uid='dexEMX' title='Bokeh Background with CSS Doodle - Step 4' />
      <p>And now we‚Äôll add a `translate` effect to move each circle‚Äôs center away from it‚Äôs origin by a random amount. This gives us an interesting clustering of circles, like neon bubbles in a champagne flute. üçæ</p>
      <CodePen uid='LmwKEz' title='Bokeh Background with CSS Doodle - Step 5' />
      <p>Finally, to get that nice bokeh look we‚Äôll put a blur filter on the :doodle selector. The css blur function unfortunately blurs the container along with the content, so to make sure we don‚Äôt see those blurry edges of the doodle we scale the size up just a little bit and add some overflow properties in our stylesheet so the edges of the doodle are off the viewport. And voila!            </p>
