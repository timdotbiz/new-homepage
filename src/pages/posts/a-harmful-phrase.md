I've been reading this book *Living an Examined Life* by James Hollis, and one of the things he talks about is how we tend to relive our traumas because they're a link to the familiar. Familiar wounds, no matter how painful, give us a consistent answer to the scariest question: "Who am I?"

Here's a trauma that I didn't even recognize as a trauma until my late twenties, when I'd burned out of grad school and a couple years of trying to make it in publishing. It's not an event, just an idea that was repeated over and over again growing up:

### Let your light shine

I was raised to believe talents are a gift from God, and God's gifts are meant to be shared. Talent is evidence of a vocation, a calling. If you have a talent, God wants you to use it. Not using it is disobedience and ingratitude. Conversely, if you aren't talented at something then God didn't give you a gift for it and you have no business doing it. Pursuing something you aren't talented at is going against God's plan for you.

You know what's missing from that equation? Happiness.

The things I'm talented at don't make me happy. I'm talented at writing, but it doesn't make me happy. I'm talented at music, but it doesn't make me happy. Writing and music, unfortunately for me, earned me praise from my mentors and admiration from my peers. I felt obliged — bound even — to let my light shine. 

I'm talented at working with computers and electronics, and they make me happy. But as a kid I never received validation for that part of myself. I got in trouble if I spent too much time on the computer. Nobody encouraged my interest in machines. I valued praise too highly, and experience taught me that technology was not a path toward praise the way writing and music were.

James Hollis says:

> Whatever health and wholeness is, it surely involves aligning our outer choices with our inner reality. When the path we are on is right for our souls, the energy is there.

In my mid-twenties, I lost the energy. I thought through self-discipline and commitment I could force myself to achieve happiness through my talents but it just doesn't work like that. I gave up.
