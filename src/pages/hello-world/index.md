I've switched from a WordPress site hosted on DreamHost to this Gatsby powered site hosted on Netlify. WordPress was adding a ton of extra complexity around my blog and DreamHost didn't give me enough control over my own server configuration choices. Gatsby let's me work with React and GraphQL, which I'm more comfortable with than PHP, and Netlify gives me confidence that things are being managed well on the server-side.

The end result: a site with a first meaningful paint time of 1.5 seconds even on throttled 3G. A site I can edit just by pushing up changes to GitHub.
