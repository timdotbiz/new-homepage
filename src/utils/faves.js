    review: `Love this single by Carpenter Brut. It has a great Stranger Things vibe. I have a hard time concentrating when a song has lyrics so I like to have instrumentals like this on hand when I want some non-distracting background noise.`,

    review: `This cartoonish farm life simulator is one of my favorite video games. It's slow paced and meditative, with little conflict or harsh consequences. It emphasizes cooperation, compassion, curiosity, diligence, and planning.`

    review: `Sad on all levels: the decay of the planet, the decline of nations, the inevitable severing of relationships. And yet it's a unique experience, strangely meditative and clarifying in a way that reminds me of Mikhail Shishkin's <a href="/faves/light-and-the-dark-shishkin">The Light and the Dark</a>.`,

    review: `An incredible novel bursting with humor, verbal fireworks, and genuine empathy. It pierces to the heart of 21st century urban life by embodying a variety of perspectives that I, as a white man, would have a hard time understanding otherwise. Can't recommend it highly enough.`

    review: `A tiny book I return to frequently for wisdom and clarity. Even as I've become less traditionally religious, these lessons from Hasidic Judaism hold true for me. Personally I prefer it to Buber's better known 'I and Thou'.`

    review: `My wife recommended this to me and I was hesitant for a while, but once I got started I couldn't put it down. Adventure, romance, history: writing about it now makes me want to read it again.`

    review: `Along with Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass' and T.S. Eliot's complete poems, one of the formative books of my teenage years. I've reread it countless times.`

    review: `Rather than just explain what Ezra Pound was writing this book rebuilds the whole context of how and why he wrote in the first place. A demanding read, but well worth the trouble if you're at all interested in literary modernism.`
