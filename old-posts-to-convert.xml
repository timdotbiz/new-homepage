  <title type='text'>Harold Bloom's "The Daemon Knows"</title>
  <content type='html'>Today the Ploughshares Blog published &lt;a href="http://blog.pshares.org/index.php/harold-blooms-song-of-self/" target="_blank"&gt;my brief essay&lt;/a&gt; on Harold Bloom's new book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Daemon-Knows-Literary-Greatness-American/dp/0812997824" target="_blank"&gt;*The Daemon Knows*&lt;/a&gt;. I feel pretty happy about it, but I know it could be a lot better. I know that some day I'll be happy with my writing because I know that I'm becoming happier with my writing, yet there's still such a long way to go. There's nothing I can do about this shitty feeling — except write!
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.pshares.org/index.php/harold-blooms-song-of-self/" target="_blank"&gt;Here’s the story of my first and only encounter with Harold Bloom.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>My Tippet — only Tulle —</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;blockquote&gt;My Tippet — only Tulle —&lt;/blockquote&gt;That's a line from Emily Dickinson's poem, &lt;a href="http://www.timreadspoetry.com/2015/06/because-i-could-not-stop-for-death-dickinson.html" target="_blank"&gt;"Because I could not stop for death"&lt;/a&gt;. It's a weird moment. The meter seems to slow way down. For a modern reader, who probably doesn't know the meaning of the words, it's a fun to feel the way the words play from the front of your mouth back into your throat.

Courtesy of Wikipedia:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippet" target="_blank"&gt;Tippet&lt;/a&gt; — a scarf-like narrow piece of clothing, worn over the shoulders. It may also be likened to a stole in the secular rather than ecclesiastic sense of this word.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulle_netting" target="_blank"&gt;Tulle&lt;/a&gt; — a lightweight, very fine netting, which is often starched. It can be made of various fibres, including silk, nylon, and rayon. Tulle is most commonly used for veils, gowns (particularly wedding gowns), and ballet tutus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The clothes the speaker of the poem is wearing aren't made for warmth. They're ceremonial—a wedding dress or, more likely, the clothes she's been buried in. The courtship theme of the poem implies that in an darkly humorous way she's become married to Death. (Jesus — how many million times has *that *been said?)

Is Dickinson satirizing death or is she satirizing romance? Neither, really. I think death is given quite a bit of respect here. And she's not being cynical about romance. What she's satirizing is the way we avoid thinking about death. We can't even call a grave a grave; we call it a house with its roof in the ground. We have to imagine death as a person rather than just this formless and all-consuming *negation*. We have to wrap everything in words—even death, even the ones we love—so that our brains and tongues can hold them. Knowledge is power. Naming things gives us a grasp on life. Naming things creatively lets us enjoy our minds and our mouths and gives us access to real power, real vitality.

Say it five times fast: "My Tippet — only Tulle —"

  <title type='text'>"Because I could not stop for death" by Emily Dickinson</title>
  <content type='html'>Oof, I'm thin skinned. I take the slightest discomfort or disappointment as a sign that I shouldn't be writing, have no business writing, would serve the world and God and my loved ones best by not writing. I'm only just now, at the age of thirty, learning that discomfort and disappointment are, for me, the essential preconditions of being a writer. We're told to do what we're passionate about, and we're told to do what makes us happy, but we're rarely told that those aren't necessarily going to be the same thing. Writing doesn't make me happy, or at least not very often, but I keep doing it anyway. I write until I get so unhappy that I think I'll be happier if I just stop writing, but that only makes it worse. So I can be either mildly unhappy writing, or deeply unhappy not writing. The choice makes itself.

I've started memorizing poems again. It's something I did in college. Keats and Yeats, mostly. The first poem I've memorized is Emily Dickinson's "Because I Could Not Stop for Death". Here's the text.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Because I could not stop for Death –
He kindly stopped for me –
The Carriage held but just Ourselves –
And Immortality.

We slowly drove – He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His Civility –

We passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess – in the Ring –
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –
We passed the Setting Sun –

Or rather – He passed us –
The Dews drew quivering and chill –
For only Gossamer, my Gown –
My Tippet – only Tulle –

We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground –
The Roof was scarcely visible –
The Cornice – in the Ground –

Since then – ‘tis Centuries – and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first surmised the Horses’ Heads
Were toward Eternity – &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/EmilyDickinson-drawing.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/EmilyDickinson-drawing.jpg" height="320" width="246" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There are a lot of boring things to say about this poem, I assume. Things that have been said by a hundred thousand undergraduates in a hundred thousand American literature classes. Why couldn't she stop for death? Is this creepy perversion of the courtship plot supposed to be a satire? If so, of what? In what sense does grain gaze? The sun, too, is like an eye. She's passing by childhood, warmth, light, food, life. What do "Tippet" and "Tulle" mean? Is that a good line or is it just weird? (Once you start memorizing the poem, this becomes one of your favorite lines.) Why isn't the speaker able to recognize the grave for what it is? Is she in denial? There's "Ground" rhyming with itself in the penultimate stanza. What's that about?

OK, most of those questions actually weren't that boring. I like to run my hand over a poem, feel its texture. Tap on it, strum it, beat it like a drum. You do this best by memorizing it. The poem &lt;em&gt;as memorized&lt;/em&gt; is an essentially different thing from the poem &lt;em&gt;as read&lt;/em&gt;. And once its there in you, then you can do anything you want with it. It's yours. It belongs to you, almost more than it ever belonged to the poet who wrote it.

The thing that interests me the most in the poem currently is the way the poem stutters in the first two lines of the last stanza.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since then – ‘tis Centuries – and yet
Feels shorter than the Day&lt;/blockquote&gt;What is the subject of "Feels"? Let's start by straightening the sentence out. "The time since then, even though it's been centuries, feels shorter than the Day[....]" "Since then" is the subject. It's a stand-in for the more logical "the time since then." "'tis Centuries" is a reduction of the phrase "the time since then has been centuries." But what about the "and yet"? Where did that come from? It indicates a hesitation or sob or wandering into thoughtlessness. The speaker is struck with the sublime power of "Centuries". The speaker leaves so much unsaid — can't even admit that it's not a house she's come to but a grave — that the horror of the empty "Centuries" gives her pause. "and yet" is a jarring attempt to get the poetry moving again. It's been such a sing-song poem so far, but here the rhythm breaks or at least trips. We feel that the speaker is upset, and we know we should feel upset as well, and we do.

I won't make any promises that I'll return to the blog tomorrow, but I hope to. I wrote this piece in an hour. I'm OK with it. I don't want to destroy it, which is saying something. Good enough. Until tomorrow, then, or whenever.

  <title type='text'>'January' by Charles Simic</title>
  <content type='html'>A couple weeks ago I picked up &lt;a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/back-issues/212" target="_blank"&gt;the new issue of *The Paris Review*&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because it has some interviews I wanted to read (Hilary Mantel, Lydia Davis, Elena Ferrante) and a new novella by &lt;a href="http://www.timreadspoetry.com/2015/03/it-isnt-me-by-james-lasdun.html" target="_blank"&gt;James Lasdun&lt;/a&gt;. But it also features some excellent poems, including three poems by Charles Simic.
Usually I'm not wild about Charles Simic. He strikes me as a rich man's poet. He's an oenophile's oenophile. I find his chumminess around the finer things distasteful. But that's my problem, not his. I'm a bit of a populist, and sometimes that clouds my judgment.
So with no more hemming and hawing, here's 'January' by Charles Simic, &lt;a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/poetry/6359/three-poems-charles-simic" target="_blank"&gt;from the Spring 2015 issue of *The Paris Review*&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Children’s fingerprints
On a frozen window
Of a small schoolhouse.

An empire, I read somewhere,
Maintains itself through
The cruelty of its prisons.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The line breaks online aren't arranged the same way as they are in print, so I've adjusted them to match the what-seems-to-me more sensible option. This is the second time I've found that a big publication didn't get the line breaks right online (the first time was with &lt;a href="http://www.timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/country-music-by-michael-robbins.html" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Robbins' 'Country Music'&lt;/a&gt;, where *The New Yorker *website did away with the line breaks entirely.)
What to say about this poem? It's a simple construction. One image and one idea, yolked together in an unlikely but clever pairing. We could interpret that image of the children's fingerprints in any number of ways, but Simic puts a great spin on it by recalling something he read once. He gives voice to something we all felt as school kids, I think: it isn't fair that we have to spend our childhoods locked up in some classroom. I went to Our Lady of Perpetual Help (OLPH) elementary school, a Catholic school run by Sisters of the Immaculate Conception; it was a good school but my we still found it hilarious to refer to OLPH as the Old Ladies' Prison Home.
The structure of this poem would make a good writing exercise. Juxtapose an image and an idea so that the second one spins the first in an interesting way. You could do the same thing with two images: I'm thinking of &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/104/106.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ezra Pound's "In a Station of the Metro"&lt;/a&gt;. The important thing is to get in and out of the reader's imagination quickly. It's a good way to make people laugh or consider an unpleasant truth that they otherwise wouldn't make time for.
That'll do it for me today. I've got a post going up on &lt;a href="http://blog.pshares.org/" target="_blank"&gt;the Ploughshares blog&lt;/a&gt; later this morning, so please do check that out. Until tomorrow, all.</content>

  <title type='text'>Bloomin' Onion</title>
  <content type='html'>I just submitted my next post for &lt;a href="http://blog.pshares.org/" target="_blank"&gt;the *Ploughshares *Blog&lt;/a&gt;. It took me way too long to write it. I've been slacking on my writing lately. I don't make time for it in the same way that I make time for other things—work, editing projects, video games, TV. I go to the movies maybe only two or three times a year but I bet I'd sooner go to the movies than sit down for an hour and just write.

My post is about a couple of poets I've reviewed here on the blog. I like that my editor at *Ploughshares *lets me quote long passages from poems. It's important to me that I can share the poetry itself rather than just talk about it abstractly. I want people to feel the thing itself. I hate abstractions. I've avoided words like "haunting" and "passion" and "human" because they just don't goddamn *mean* anything. I hate those lazy tokens of the craft. I don't want to be lazy. I want to be bold, like Harold Bloom.

I remember the first time I heard someone criticize Harold Bloom. I'd been pulling *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Western-Canon-Books-School-Ages/dp/1573225142" target="_blank"&gt;The Western Canon &lt;/a&gt;*and *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Genius-Mosaic-Hundred-Exemplary-Creative/dp/0446527173" target="_blank"&gt;Genius &lt;/a&gt;*and *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shakespeare-Invention-Human-Harold-Bloom/dp/157322751X" target="_blank"&gt;Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human &lt;/a&gt;*out of the college library for a whole year. My favorite high school English teacher had given us an excerpt from the Shakespeare&amp;nbsp;book and I loved it. I was reading a lot of Nietzsche at the time, so I was ready for that kind of grand, generalizing voice. But then some guys I met in college told me how much they hated Bloom and I thought, "Oh, there's something here I should hate." They said they read&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Western-Canon-Books-School-Ages/dp/1573225142" style="font-style: italic;" target="_blank"&gt;The Western Canon&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;and hated it so much that they burned their copies on a hibachi grill. "Oh, jeeze, I really shouldn't like this stuff."

I would have told you I was a go-my-own-way type of guy back in college but the truth is I was deeply impressionable. I let people I barely knew dictate my tastes because I wanted them to like me. I have, over the years, become more boring. There's no getting around that. I'm less adventurous, less confrontational, less involved. I'm trying to fight back against the boredom, but it's definitely winning.

So yeah, I stopped reading Bloom, even though I still liked the boldness of his pronouncements. Bloom slaps his hand on the table and says "This is just how things are!" The subtext being "And fuck you if you don't believe it." I like his egomania, the way he can't stop talking about himself. I like that Bloom is a Yale guy. He lives that swagger and pomposity to its honest fulfillment. I sat in on the first session of a class he did for undergrads. The room was packed and he said at the end, "I'm going to go and sit in one of the classrooms somewhere in the building. If you're serious about taking this course, write out a few hundred words about why you should be allowed in and come find me." Who goddamn *does&amp;nbsp;*that?

So here's what I say to those guys who burned copies of &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Western-Canon-Books-School-Ages/dp/1573225142" style="font-style: italic;" target="_blank"&gt;The Western Canon&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;on their hibachi grill: fuck you guys. Literature is a creator's game, not an analyst's. Literary criticism is weighted down with a thousand thousand milquetoasts and poetasters; what we want are bold voices who are willing to be wrong in order to get it right. You can and should argue with Harold Bloom, but that's only because he's bold enough to say things that are worth arguing about. The stakes of his arguments are high: he's trying to define the shape of humanity. Writers: can you say the stakes of your arguments are high?</content>

  <title type='text'>Cranking</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I'm writing this post on my tablet. It's a relatively inexpensive Samsung Galaxy tab. It does that thing where you can just drag your finger across the keyboard and it guesses what you wanted to type. It's shockingly accurate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I'm not so much writing a post as going to crank one out. Hence the title. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What is a post on a blog? To me there are two ways of speaking: prepared and extemporaneous. Most writing is akin to prepared speech. But blog writing is akin to extemporaneous speech. To me,&amp;#160; that's its chief appeal. That's the appeal of cheaply produced podcasts. That's the appeal of comic books. It's culture hot off the press. It's clunky and clich&amp;#233; and closer to the beating heart of everyday thought and speech than anything you'll find in novel or book of poems.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I'm listening to Marc Ribot while I crank. I had a serious jazz phase in high school and college. It started with Chick Corea and Al di Meola but moved to Miles Davis and Medeski, Martin and Wood and then a ton of Dave Douglas and Marc Ribot and Uri Caine. After my jazz phase I got really into classical,&amp;nbsp; then talk radio and podcasts,&amp;nbsp; and now here we are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Alright, that's all for today. More later, poetry lovers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Returning to "It Isn't Me" by James Lasdun</title>
  <content type='html'>I discovered &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Richard-Rohr/e/B000AQ2WB4" target="_blank"&gt;Richard Rohr&lt;/a&gt; yesterday thanks to &lt;a href="http://nerdist.com/you-made-it-weird-253-richard-rohr/" target="_blank"&gt;a podcast by Pete Holmes&lt;/a&gt;. Rohr is a Franciscan on "the edge of the inside" of Christianity. That phrase means he's just Christian enough to call himself Christian, but (refreshingly) he recognizes the contingency of his faith. He was born to devout Christian parents in rural Kansas; as he says in the interview with Pete Holmes, he'd be a devout Hindu now if he'd been born in India. In other words, there are many paths to revelation, reintegration, resurrection. There is no one true way. There are as many paths as there are people.

Jesus. He's all over this &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/238284" target="_blank"&gt;"It Isn't Me"&lt;/a&gt; poem by James Lasdun, isn't he? "they couldn’t, in the end, believe in him, / except as some half-legendary figure / destined, or doomed, to carry on his back // the weight of their own all-but-weightless, stray / doubts and discomforts." The dropout, the loser, the person who doesn't quite fit in: that's Jesus.

It's also the artist. Or the romantic artist. The genius.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/2454203" target="_blank"&gt;Here's a great essay by Lasdun on the poet/translator Michael Hofmann, entitled "A Sherlock of Poems"&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a great quote:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;In Mexico Michael  declared with sublime intransigence that the Mason-Dixon line ran along the Canadian border, and that the flocks of obvious (if rather small) pigeons in Cuernavaca were in fact quail. These rare but striking lapses from omniscience put me in mind of Sherlock Holmes’s apparent ignorance of the fact that the earth revolves around the sun. The lacunae became, somehow, further evidence of the genius. And I suspect I am not the only friend of Michael’s who feels a little ploddingly Watson-like in his company, or, for that matter, who regards him as something like the Sherlock Holmes of British poetry: preternaturally attuned to reality, somewhat inclined to disappear, and always several leagues ahead of everyone else.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Genius and goodness lead to loneliness. They make you admirable, yes, but they separate you. Others feel like Watsons in the presence of the genius or the saint. Some people like that feeling; many more, I would think, resent it. Jesus had plenty of admirers, but in the end there were more (and more powerful) people who hated him.

"Genius and goodness lead to loneliness." Do I really believe that? No, not really. That's how it appears to people in the center, but not to the person on the edge of the inside. To the individual who takes the wider perspective—the unpopular perspective—separation from the insiders isn't a problem. It's a natural part of being true to oneself. *&lt;b&gt;It is a source of joy&lt;/b&gt;*. Not *seeming *joy. Not "I guess *technically *I'm happy" joy. &lt;b&gt;*Real joy*&lt;/b&gt;.

I forget that too often. Sometimes I just want so bad to *belong to a group. *People who love poetry. People who love comic books. Computer programmers. Literature nuts. But none of that none of that none of that will make me happy unless I'm a secure, confident, comfortable individual &lt;u&gt;first&lt;/u&gt;. And that comes with being true to myself, being able to look at the things that I want even though I know they're bad for me (and even though they're good for other people) and say, "It isn't me."</content>

  <title type='text'>"It Isn't Me" by James Lasdun</title>
  <content type='html'>Lately I've been reading a collection of &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/james-lasdun" target="_blank"&gt;James Lasdun&lt;/a&gt;'s poems that will be coming out from Farrar Straus and Giroux this spring. I'd never read his poetry before. (That's a phrase I should stop using on this blog. I say it too often. One must accept one's newbishness. Mustn't one?) And I'm really enjoying it, mostly.

&lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/james-lasdun#about" target="_blank"&gt;The Poetry Foundation has made a few of his poems available online&lt;/a&gt;. "Blues for Samson" is one of my least favorite in the collection. I get the clever play on a modern Samson and Delilah story, but it's a little blah, a little too clever and macho for it's own good. (Side note: The best thing I've ever read about men's haircuts is the story "A Short History of Hairdressing" from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Lemon-Table-Julian-Barnes/dp/1400076501" target="_blank"&gt;Julian Barnes' collection of short stories, &lt;/a&gt;*&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Lemon-Table-Julian-Barnes/dp/1400076501" target="_blank"&gt;The Lemon Table&lt;/a&gt;.*) But the other two poems they feature are ones I've really enjoyed. Here's &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/238284" target="_blank"&gt;"It Isn't Me", from the December 2009 issue of *Poetry *magazine&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;blockquote&gt;*It isn’t me*, he’d say,
stepping out of a landscape
that offered, he’d thought, the backdrop
to a plausible existence
until he entered it; *it’s just not me*,
he’d murmur, walking away.

*It’s not quite me*, he’d explain,
apologetic but firm,
leaving some job they’d found him.
They found him others: he’d go,
smiling his smile, putting
his best foot forward, till again

he’d find himself reluctantly concluding
that this, too, wasn’t him.
He wanted to get married, make a home,
unfold a life among his neighbors’ lives,
branching and blossoming like a tree,
but when it came to it, *it isn’t me*

was all he seemed to learn
from all his diligent forays outward.
And why it should be so hard
for someone not so different from themselves,
to find what they’d found, barely even seeking;
what gift he’d not been given, what forlorn

charm of his they’d had the luck to lack,
puzzled them—though not unduly:
they lived inside their lives so fully
they couldn’t, in the end, believe in him,
except as some half-legendary figure
destined, or doomed, to carry on his back

the weight of their own all-but-weightless, stray
doubts and discomforts. Only sometimes,
alone in offices or living rooms,
they’d hear that phrase again: *it isn’t me*,
and wonder, briefly, what they were, and where,
and feel the strangeness of being there. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/129/" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Melville's "Bartleby the Scrivener"&lt;/a&gt; comes to mind. Who is this character? What's his relation to "it"? What does he mean by "me"? Is he right to demand that the circumstances of his environment and his job and his social arrangements suit him? I want to say to him, "Of course *it *isn't *you*! That's life!" But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I feel so vehemently opposed to his way (or rejection) of life because I'm suppressing my own inner mantra of "it isn't me." &lt;b&gt;The repressed always returns in disguise, *often as a strong emotion*&lt;/b&gt;.

I'll come back to this soon. I also want to look at &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/244176" target="_blank"&gt;"The Blight"&lt;/a&gt;. Until next time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="fb-like" data-href="http://www.timreadspoetry.com/2015/03/it-isnt-me-by-james-lasdun.html" data-layout="button_count" data-action="like" data-show-faces="false" data-share="true"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Gratitude</title>
  <content type='html'>Yesterday I received a new biography of T.S. Eliot in the mail. I didn't ask for it; the publisher just sent it to me.

This morning I read (for the twentieth or thirtieth time) a book of poems that I'll be reviewing this coming month. I've been in touch with the author (whose one of my favorite poets writing today) and I've been able to get his answers to some specific questions.

Would any of this have been possible if I hadn't started blogging over this last year? &lt;b&gt;Absolutely not&lt;/b&gt;.

I feel, right now, a tremendous sense of gratitude. Doing what I like, saying what I feel, expressing my confusion and my enthusiasm (is there anything more embarrassing?)—these have brought me more interesting and important experiences than I would have ever thought possible. I feel a tremendous sense of gratitude right now.

Thanks for reading. :-)</content>

  <title type='text'>'Orality, Literacy, and the Memorized Poem' by Mike Chasar</title>
  <content type='html'>Hey all! I want to kick off this week by reading a recent non-fiction piece from Poetry Magazine. I wasn't crazy about much of the poetry in the issue, but I did enjoy &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/249542#article" target="_blank"&gt;this essay by Mike Chasar, entitled "Orality, Literacy, and the Memorized Poem"&lt;/a&gt;.

Here's the TL;DR: poetry in the form of text has more social clout in the U.S. than poetry in the form of spoken words. Why? Because educational systems push people out of the oral economy and into the literal/literate economy. Literacy is a stamp of approval; the author provides authority.

Here are several choice quotes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #404040; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;In his now classic study&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style="background-color: white; color: #404040; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #404040; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;, Walter J. Ong traces the differences in communication forms and dynamics between oral and literate cultures, distinguishing between the fixity and abstracted knowledge of print (which “sets up conditions for ‘objectivity,’ in the sense of personal disengagement or distancing”) and the “situational, operational frames of reference” of orality and its real-time, personal exchanges.... For Ong, the values of oral and print economies exist in relation to one another in the modern, Western world of widespread literacy, where most oral communication is in some way underwritten, made possible by, or in a sort of dialogue with, the technology and authority of print....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;You follow what he's saying here? As I understand it, Ong is contending that the spoken word is tethered to the written word. The written word says, "You can go as far as I would go, but no further." When people *say *what cannot be *written *(and I'm extrapolating a bit here)&amp;nbsp;we step into the world of class conflict. Think about it: don't you cringe a little when a professor sounds *too *much like a book? They're walking a fine line between the spoken and written word. All professionals are. Professional speakers crack jokes and make little gestures toward the casual world of speech as if to say "I know all this book stuff, and I'm going to keep talking about it in a bookish way, but really I'm just like you." It's a question of who's in and who's out. So what's that have to do with poetry?
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #404040; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;Among its other functions, the memorized poem in the schoolroom becomes a crucial intersection of oral and print economies, as the spoken display of one’s mastery enlists values associated with orality (bodily carriage, gesture, intonation, and elocution) even as word-for-word fidelity to the original, printed text remains the  primary measure of achievement....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #404040; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;Having gained momentum and come to seem even more natural thanks to the privileged place of rote memorization, those values still inform, albeit in somewhat refracted ways, how we relate to certain sorts of poetry (and poetry delivery systems)  differently than to others today. Publication in the little magazine or the slim volume, for example, is a far more “credible” sign of a poet’s accomplishment — far more likely to elicit respect, scholarly consideration, and even promotion or tenure — than poetry in performance or other non-print contexts, historical or contemporary. The same poem is likely to acquire a credibility when presented in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style="background-color: white; color: #404040; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;Poetry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #404040; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;that it loses if “interpreted” on air by&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/garrison-keillor" style="background-color: white; color: #045482; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; outline: none; text-decoration: none;"&gt;Garrison Keillor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #404040; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;. This is one reason why poets with print-based, rather than performance-based, résumés “read” at presidential inaugurations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The difference between oral and print economies isn't just about how we interpret poetry; it impacts the type of poetry people choose to write. Certain poets — I'll say *most* poets — want to be credible. The way to be credible as a poet is to be published. If you can, you get a position at a university teaching poetry. Authorship and authority: those are the two keys to the Kingdom of Professional Poetry. And your poetry becomes bookish, highly allusive. Like T.S. Eliot you provide notes to the allusions in your own poems. Chasar's description of a poetry reading is dead-on:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #404040; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;The management of the relationship between oral and print value economies comes into view most clearly (at least in the context of what&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/charles-bernstein" style="background-color: white; color: #045482; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; outline: none; text-decoration: none;"&gt;Charles Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #404040; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;has called “official verse culture”) in the phenomenon of the professional poetry “reading,” which uses  a print-based term to describe what is otherwise a recitation for the purposes of saving the endeavor from its affiliation with the oral. The last thing a professional poet wants is to risk being linked to the history of recitation and its accumulated values, and so he or she goes through a set of gestures meant to anchor his or her performance in print. She reads in a more or less standardized, even impersonal, style with little intonation and few if any theatrical gestures. She disengages from the work itself by not memorizing it. She makes a show of displaying, paging through, or talking about her books or manuscripts. And she references the poem’s social ties not in regard to the immediacy of what Ong calls the “existential present” (i.e., the  moment of the poetry reading itself), but, rather, in regard to its biographical impetus, moment of inspiration, or compositional process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;(I have to say, I don't like the way Chasar makes this fictional poet female. It's harmless enough in most cases to use the feminine pronoun generically, but here he's creating too much of a contrast between this straw-woman poet and virile figures like Charles Bernstein and Robert Frost. Even if you're reading generously, it comes off as sexist.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Chasar, this reader's opposite would be Robert Frost, who improvised during his reading at JFK's inauguration. By improvising, Frost put aside the tradition of his own work and embraced the spirit of the moment. He put the oral before the literal at a crucial moment. What does that say about the U.S.? What does that say about who we were, and who we are becoming?

Frost valued the spirit over the letter. Chasar does, too, and so do I. Should that make a difference in how we read? In how we write? Does this knowledge change us? Does it imply a critical ethics? A practical ethics? I don't know. But it's a rare article that can bring these issues up so plainly and strikingly. Chasar pushes you to take a side. Good for him. And good for *Poetry* for publishing it. &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/249542#article" target="_blank"&gt;Go read the whole thing&lt;/a&gt;.

Until Wednesday, meinen Freunden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://www.timreadspoetry.com/2015/01/orality-literacy-and-memorized-poem-by.html" data-text="Reading Mike Chasar's essay in the newest @poetrymagazine." data-via="timreadspoetry"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.timreadspoetry.com%2F2015%2F01%2Forality-literacy-and-memorized-poem-by.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Resolutions</title>
  <content type='html'>Browsing through the Blogging subreddit, I was pleased to find a post entitled &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/2r080u/what_are_your_blogging_related_new_years/" target="_blank"&gt;'What are your blogging related New Year's Resolutions?'&lt;/a&gt; The most upvoted comment is from user CulinariaBlog, who said "Try to find more blogs I like and comment in them." I think that's a great resolution. There are plenty of 'post more regularly' resolutions, but none of that does much if we bloggers aren't reading and supporting one another. And support isn't just giving one another a pat on the back; it's asking hard questions, expecting more from each other as thinkers and writers. I'll follow these redditors lead and make a better effort to engage with my fellow bloggers.

I've got a few resolutions this year, mostly related to fitness and professional development, but I've got literary goals, too. Last year I wrote over a hundred blog posts, four published articles, a half-dozen or so poems I was pretty proud of, and (God help me) a short novel. I'm not sure I really want to do much more than that; I just want to redistribute my efforts a bit. No more miserable novel writing, that's for damn sure.

I want to keep my prose writing to non-fiction about poets and poetry. I want my reading to feed my non-fiction; my reading will be *research*, a term I dislike because I know that actual scholarly research is far more strenuous than anything I'll be doing.

And I want to be more diligent about setting aside time to write poetry, and some time to submit my poems to journals. I've sent poems to five or six journals in the past year and received nothing but rejections. I took it poorly, let it get me down, and quit trying. This year, I'm resolved to keep pushing at it and finally get some poetry published.

So much for resolutions. In tomorrow's post I'll feature a poem. Until then.</content>

  <title type='text'>A New Year; 'Asking the Way' by Ko Un</title>
  <content type='html'>I've spent most of today writing my next post for Ploughshares. But of course, it's the first day of the new year, so I'm also thinking about the year ahead and the year that's just past. What was I happy with? What could I have done better? What lessons can I draw that will help me in the year ahead?

I was unhappy with the way I slowed down on this blog over the course of the last half-year. I really enjoyed the early days of the blog when I was putting up new material daily. And honestly, even though I repeatedly allow myself the excuse that not writing a post is a time-saver, I know that that's not really true. Writing a post each morning, which usually took no more than an hour, was a tremendous energy and confidence boost.

So I think &lt;b&gt;I'm going to bring back the daily format&lt;/b&gt;. Last year &lt;a href="http://blog.pshares.org/index.php/a-year-spent-reading-100-books/" target="_blank"&gt;I read voraciously&lt;/a&gt; and wrote sporadically. This year I'm going to write like a beast, and my reading will be the food that keeps the writing strong. Wow — for someone who writes about poetry, I am terrible at metaphors.

Here's a fitting poem for beginning anew. It's called 'Asking the Way,' by the Korean poet &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/ko-un" target="_blank"&gt;Ko Un&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;blockquote&gt;You fools who ask what god is
should ask what life is instead.
Find a port where lemon trees bloom.
Ask about places to drink in the port.
Ask about the drinkers.
Ask about the lemon trees.
Ask and ask until nothing’s left to ask.

— &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/248986" target="_blank"&gt;translated by Suji Kwock Kim and Sunja Kim Kwock in the November 2014 issue of Poetry Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;What a taut, unassuming little poem! Someone new to the English language could read this with little trouble and come away from it refreshed and enlightened. There are questions to ask about this poem, certainly, but not because it makes obscure references or difficult vocabulary or contorted syntax. Its surface is smooth and pleasant. It fits in your hand or in your mouth. (What am I saying? I'm not completely sure, but I know it's true. This sort of discover is exactly why I need to write more often.)

The poem consists of a single declarative sentence followed by five imperatives. Each of the imperatives seems to drive forward the same point. The last imperative summarizes and can replace all the other four, except that it can't because the repetition is enacting the poem's rhetorical point: you should keep asking and asking, repeating until (if it's possible) you come to the end.

The speaker is rejecting inquiry into god in favor of inquiry into the world. The abstract is left behind for the particular. He tells the fools they "should ask what life is" but of course "life" is a very broad concept. He clarifies: "life" is the stories and details and truths that can be offered about people and places and things. "Life" is being in and talking about the world. "god" is not that; "god" is outside the world; there is no one to ask about "god" and no one who can tell about "god"; "god" is not the life, or the truth, or the way.

Ah, I'm looking forward to another year of reading poetry. Until tomorrow, friends.

  <title type='text'>My first article on the Ploughshares Blog</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://blog.pshares.org/index.php/a-year-spent-reading-100-books/"&gt;My first post on the Ploughshares Blog is now live&lt;/a&gt;. I've obsessed over this article for the last month—changing words and word orders and punctuation and then changing them all back—so it's nice to have it out of my hands.

Many thanks to my wife, Amy, and my friend Ethan Chatagnier for reading drafts and giving great advice on how to improve this article. Maybe some day I'll learn to control my anxiety about my own writing, but it won't be any time soon.

  <title type='text'>Michael Robbins on 'A Poem for President Drone'</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;div class="tr_bq"&gt;Following up on &lt;a href="http://www.timreadspoetry.com/2014/12/political-poetry-staples-robbins.html" target="_blank"&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt;, Michael Robbins forwarded me &lt;a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/a-poem-for-president-drone" target="_blank"&gt;an article he wrote (published in the Los Angeles Review of Books)&lt;/a&gt; about 'A Poem for President Drone'. It's a really interesting and incendiary summary of his position on the drone program and our willful blindness to its horrible violence. Here's a highlight:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Because violent civilian deaths are all too common in Mideast war zones like Pakistan, and uncommon in suburban American communities like Newtown, Connecticut, it makes perfect sense that a person would get more exercised about the latter. This could well be true, but it misses the point. I, for one, am not bewildered by people being more upset about the Newtown victims than they are about the children their taxes help to murder in Pakistan and Yemen. I simply believe that they should be as upset about the latter. Or more so.

Leaving aside the absolutely relevant fact that the United States is not currently at war with Pakistan or Yemen, is there a “moral difference” between the cases at issue? Of course there is: you and I bear no responsibility for the Newtown shootings. (I suppose one could argue that we bear a slight responsibility, insofar as we have not been active enough in the fight for sane gun legislation, but let that go.) But we are indeed complicit in the deaths of those 64 Pakistani children. It is our government that is killing them, after all. The drones and their operators are bought and paid for with our money. And there is a remarkable venality in the suggestion that, because children live in a war zone, their deaths matter less. The more trenchant question is whether our attacks on Pakistani citizens are immoral. I believe they are. And I believe that our president is a war criminal with the blood of innocent children on his hands. No doubt that makes me an infantile leftist. There are worse fates.

—&lt;a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/a-poem-for-president-drone"&gt;from the Los Angeles Review of Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Sure, all politicians—including the President—deserve unflinching scrutiny and fearless critique. But sometimes as a writer you can go so far to the left that you end up saying things the right would just *love* to quote you on. I don't want to get into my own politics here too much, but Robbins' sharp criticism raises the point: is it the poet's place to be the thorn in the establishment's side? Is Robbins even speaking as 'the poet Michael Robbins' here, or isn't it rather that he's speaking as a citizen? Or is such a separation even possible? I'm not too sure where I fall here, though I do know that I wouldn't say what Robbins has said. I would be too afraid that I was being rash, and I would be unsure that I wasn't doing more harm than good.&lt;br/&gt;

  <title type='text'>Political Poetry: Heidi Lynn Staples and Michael Robbins</title>
  <content type='html'>Last week I looked at &lt;a href="http://www.timreadspoetry.com/2014/11/who-burns-for-perfection-of-paper.html" target="_blank"&gt;a poem by Martín Espada&lt;/a&gt;, which I read as a political poem. But Espada's poem was very straight-faced; I'd like to look at some political poems that use humor to satirize their objects. First, &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/" target="_blank"&gt;from the latest issue of *The American Poetry Review*&lt;/a&gt;, I want to read&amp;nbsp;'O Anti O Antiphons' by Heidi Lynn Staples.
&lt;blockquote&gt;O man-made machine who fakes man as Thing and Foresaker, the rope
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;shipped around our neck  of the woods, Come to enslave us
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;to our owned hours, O body become Bot.
O Smart Phone, who flames from the mouth if a screen, waiting in the
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;pockets, lights in the  mall’s smallest darkness, Come, recognize
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;our vices.
O keyboard O Facebook, and Social Media and WWW, whose ever-
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;widening “Buyer!” has been  let loose and pawned the words:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Come, and bring forth “Friend”, let us bow together  before your
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cyclops.
O keyboard and clicker of the Digital Age, who can recognize my face
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;from among the masses  and hunt me down and destroy me from
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;any remote location: Come, come and watch  over us.
O biotech implant, over become lover, O biotech Virus of Neural
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Plaquing, how skull no longer  offers isolation.
O Predator Drone, O Hummingbird Drone, O Bee Drone Swarm how
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;hovers: Come, and, let us  watch a man-made machine unmake a
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;man unto forsaken thing, Come into the  classrooms of our youth
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and hear how we laugh.
O robotic nurse, who can sing, who can dance, who stands ready with
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;outstretched metal rubber-  encased arms and movement-tracking
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;tearless eyes before our bodily suffering she shall  not waver:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Come and deliver into their beds our soft bodies, pliable babies, into your  arms,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;into your arms, into your arms, forever more
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and more…

—&lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/poem/o-anti-o-antiphons" target="_blank"&gt;text from *The American Poetry Review* website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;There are several rhetorical devices/structures clearly at work. The three big ones are:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;"&lt;b&gt;Apostrophe &lt;/b&gt;(Greek ἀποστροφή, apostrophé, "turning away"; the final e being sounded) is an exclamatory figure of speech. It occurs when a speaker breaks off from addressing the audience (e.g. in a play) and directs speech to a third party such as an opposing litigant or some other individual, sometimes absent from the scene." &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe_(figure_of_speech)" target="_blank"&gt;—source&lt;/a&gt;

"In rhetoric, an &lt;b&gt;anaphora &lt;/b&gt;(Greek: ἀναφορά, "carrying back") is a rhetorical device that consists of repeating a sequence of words at the beginnings of neighboring clauses, thereby lending them emphasis." &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphora_(rhetoric)" target="_blank"&gt;—source&lt;/a&gt;

"&lt;b&gt;Litany&lt;/b&gt;, in Christian worship and some forms of Judaic worship, is a form of prayer used in services and processions, and consisting of a number of petitions. The word comes from the Latin litania from Ancient Greek: λιτανεία (litaneía), which in turn comes from Ancient Greek: λιτή (litê), meaning "supplication"." &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litany" target="_blank"&gt;—source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The poetic speaker is turning away from us, the listeners, to address these technological gods. The implication is that we turn with the speaker and join in the worship. So it's mock-religious speech, which is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; to say that it's mocking religion. In fact, the poem relies on our belief in the power and importance of religious speech to emphasize that these lauded technologies &lt;u&gt;aren't worthy&lt;/u&gt; of worship. There's a bit of &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/179381" target="_blank"&gt;Allen Ginsberg's 'Howl'&lt;/a&gt; in here, I think. And inside that is quite a bit of Walt Whitman.&amp;nbsp;Ginsberg and Whitman&amp;nbsp;were drawing from the American oratorical tradition of the fiery sermon, which is rich in&amp;nbsp;anaphora and litany. Both Ginsberg and Whitman asserted that there was holiness to be found everywhere. By turning the religious imagery onto unworthy gods, Staples makes us see that the holiness isn't exactly &lt;u&gt;every&lt;/u&gt;where. She finds what Ginsberg found in the second section of 'Howl': Moloch, the child-devouring god.

Satire is among the least cynical things in the world. Satire singles out the base because it believes so strongly in the noble. Satire singles out the profane because it believes so strongly in the holy.

Is this poem properly political? Sure, though of a certain kind. It's political in that it rejects a dominant ideology (more technology is *always&amp;nbsp;*good). But it doesn't single anybody out. It doesn't refer to any particular politician or policy. It's not invective. For something a little more like that, I'd like to turn to a poem by Michael Robbins (&lt;a href="http://www.timreadspoetry.com/2014/08/country-music-by-michael-robbins.html" target="_blank"&gt;whom I've read here on the blog&amp;nbsp;before&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="http://michaelrobbinspoet.tumblr.com/post/40735037994/this-is-a-poem-for-president-drone" target="_blank"&gt;As Robbins tells it on his blog&lt;/a&gt;, he was commissioned by Yahoo! to write an inaugural poem, but they refused to publish it because it contains the word "queef." Oh well.
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a poem for President Drone.
It was written by a camel.
Can I borrow your phone?
This is for President Mark Hamill.

Newtown sounds a red alert.
Mark Hamill asks is Ernie burnt?
Every camel’s a first-person shooter.
The Prez’s fez is haute couture.

It seems strange that he should be offended.
The same orders are given by him.
Paging Pakistan and Yemen.
Calling all the drone-dead children.

The camel can’t come to the phone.
This is for the drone-in-chief.
Mumbai used to be Bombay.
The bomb bay opens with a queef.

&lt;a href="http://michaelrobbinspoet.tumblr.com/post/40735037994/this-is-a-poem-for-president-drone"&gt;—text from Michael Robbins' blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Like Staples, Robbins is setting the tone of the form (bouncy, fun) against the content (the Newtown massacre, President Obama's unprecedented use of killer drones). This intentional mismatch of form to content lets us *feel *that something is deeply out of sorts. Praising something that doesn't deserve it, having fun with something deadly serious — we react almost *physically *to the wrongness of it.

But the content here is also cutting. President Obama is called 'President Drone', 'President Mark Hamill' (a reference, perhaps, to Ronald Reagan's Star Wars program), and "the drone-in-chief." Like Staples, Robbins is using apostrophe to turn directly to someone else and we're supposed to turn with him. But it's *the President*. As an Obama supporter, the poem makes me cringe. As a New Englander I cringe to hear the deaths of children in Yemen and Pakistan compared to the Newtown massacre, but there it is. That's the gauntlet Robbins has thrown down, *and he's not wrong*. Robbins isn't just challenging the President; he's challenging *us*.

---

I'd like to continue looking at more political poetry in the months ahead. It's been a nice journey in the last six months that I've been blogging. I feel like I'm settling more into a niche, learning the poets and journals I like and getting a better sense of where to look to be part of the conversation. Though I've still got a lot to learn. Well, a little at a time. I'll be back on Friday looking at a poem by Philip Levine. Until then, do check out *&lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/" target="_blank"&gt;The American Poetry Review&lt;/a&gt;*, Heidi Lynn Staples' &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Noise-Event-Heidi-Lynn-Staples/dp/1934103411" target="_blank"&gt;*Noise Event*&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;and Michael Robbins' *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Second-Sex-Poets-Penguin/dp/0143126644" target="_blank"&gt;The Second Sex&lt;/a&gt;*.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://www.timreadspoetry.com/2014/12/political-poetry-staples-robbins.html" data-text="Reading poems by @HLynnStap and @alienvsrobbins on the blog today. @AmPoetryReview" data-via="timreadspoetry"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.timreadspoetry.com%2F2014%2F12%2Fpolitical-poetry-staples-robbins.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Butter' by Elizabeth Alexander</title>
  <content type='html'>Happy Thanksgiving! Not going to editorialize this time; just gonna share a poem and get back to my own style of Thanksgiving hijinks. Here's 'Butter' by Elizabeth Alexander: &lt;blockquote&gt;My mother loves butter more than I do,
more than anyone. She pulls chunks off
the stick and eats it plain, explaining
cream spun around into butter! Growing up
we ate turkey cutlets sauteed in lemon
and butter, butter and cheese on green noodles,
butter melting in small pools in the hearts
of Yorkshire puddings, butter better
than gravy staining white rice yellow,
butter glazing corn in slipping squares,
butter the lava in white volcanoes
of hominy grits, butter softening
in a white bowl to be creamed with white
sugar, butter disappearing into
whipped sweet potatoes, with pineapple,
butter melted and curdy to pour
over pancakes, butter licked off the plate
with warm Alaga syrup. When I picture
the good old days I am grinning greasy
with my brother, having watched the tiger
chase his tail and turn to butter. We are
Mumbo and Jumbo’s children despite
historical revision, despite
our parent’s efforts, glowing from the inside
out, one hundred megawatts of butter.

  <title type='text'>'Who Burns for the Perfection of Paper' by Martín Espada</title>
  <content type='html'>We're all busy trying to make life better for ourselves and the people we love, but none of us goes about it in exactly the same way.&amp;nbsp;There are different types of labor and there are different types of laborers, and each owes something to the other.&amp;nbsp;Paradoxically, this variety of desires all pulling in different directions doesn't result in chaos but in relative harmony. The problem is that if we act as though everyone *didn't* depend on everyone else,&amp;nbsp;if we *refuse *to acknowledge this interconnection of all things,&amp;nbsp;the result is discord.

Here's&amp;nbsp;'Who Burns for the Perfection of Paper' by Martín Espada:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At sixteen, I worked after high school hours
at a printing plant
that manufactured legal pads:
Yellow paper
stacked seven feet high
and leaning
as I slipped cardboard
between the pages,
then brushed red glue
up and down the stack.
No gloves: fingertips required
for the perfection of paper,
smoothing the exact rectangle.
Sluggish by 9 PM, the hands
would slide along suddenly sharp paper,
and gather slits thinner than the crevices
of the skin, hidden.
Then the glue would sting,
hands oozing
till both palms burned
at the punchclock.

Ten years later, in law school,
I knew that every legal pad
was glued with the sting of hidden cuts,
that every open lawbook
was a pair of hands
upturned and burning.

— &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/248136" target="_blank"&gt;from the Poetry Foundation website; full citation info here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The poem moves from a personal, individual experience to a larger sense of the interconnectedness of labors. We get the gritty and sensual details, and then we're invited to imagine those details multiplied by the thousands and the millions. He makes us feel exhausted, he makes us feel like we've been cut, and then he turns that feeling into an idea. He could have chosen any kind of book or type of paper, but he chose the lawbook and the legal pad. He forces us to ask, "What is justice?"
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Prisons are built with Stones of Law, Brothels with Bricks of Religion.
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;— &lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/proverbs-hell"&gt;William Blake, *Proverbs of Hell*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;We need to be more grateful. Do you think about where your books came from? Where your computer came from? Your clothes? Your food? Look at everything around you and understand that it was made by human care and labor. At some point a teenager in another country, in exchange for wages we would consider criminal here in the United States, built some little piece of your world with their bare hands. I'm not saying, "Maybe that happened." It happened. You might make wiser, more humane political decisions if you appreciated that fact. Awareness is political. Gratitude is political.

I'm interested in Espada's sort of political poetry because it trusts in language. The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poet types call their work political, but they do it in such an arch, clever way that they restrict their audience to other poets like themselves. They subvert normal language and the rules of grammar in order to make a point about the way language is twisted and hollowed out by politicians and businessmen. It's a good idea, but what's the use of speaking about urgent matters in a language people don't understand? Espada's poetry, on the other hand, isn't so paranoid or conspiratorial as to think that the powers that be have corrupted language to its core. He uses ordinary language because he believes in the goodness of the ordinary. You have to believe in the essential goodness of the ordinary if there's to be any hope politically. The remedy for corrupted language isn't snarky parody; the remedy is *&lt;b&gt;more beautiful language that restores our faith in the power and dignity of common language&lt;/b&gt;*. Having that faith, one is better equipped to believe in the power and dignity of common people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/11/who-burns-for-perfection-of-paper.html" data-text="Reading Martín Espada's 'Who Burns for the Perfection of Paper'" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F11%2Fwho-burns-for-perfection-of-paper.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Dylan Thomas's 'Do not go gentle into that good night'</title>
  <content type='html'>Continuing &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/11/dylan-thomas-beavers-and-do-not-go.html" target="_blank"&gt;my train of thought from Monday's post&lt;/a&gt;, I want to try and read Dylan Thomas's 'Do not go gentle into that good night' as something other than a #YOLO poem. I don't want to take away anybody's enjoyment of the poem, but I think the depth of that word "rage" is under-appreciated. It's not "Rage Against the Machine" rage; it's something much harder and heavier and sadder than that. &lt;b&gt;Warning: the way I read this poem is a real bummer, so don't keep going if you're looking for a morning pick-me-up.&lt;/b&gt; Let's take it one stanza at a time.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. &lt;/blockquote&gt;This first stanza is easily quotable. The two refrains (read up on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanelle" target="_blank"&gt;villanelle&lt;/a&gt; form if you need to) appear here as imperative statements. They tell&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt; what to do. That will change soon, as will our sense of who the "you" in this poem is. When he's not giving us these imperatives, Thomas is describing different kinds of men. First there's the old men. They should (but, we imagine, they often *don't*) go unwillingly into death. Then there are the wise men:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Philosophy, Socrates teaches, is preparation for a good death. Thomas would throw back that even if you know that death is good (and I challenge you not to roll your eyes when Socrates says this)&amp;nbsp;you still recognize the impotence of this knowledge. Your words have "forked no lighting": words and knowledge don't stop your fate, words don't change the fundamental condition of being human which is mortality. Now for the good men:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Good deeds — *all *deeds, in fact — come to an end. Being good over and over again, like waves lapping on a shore, isn't enough to make a man at peace with death. There's always more to be done or, more to Thomas's point, the good we've done is never really enough. The times could have been more receptive to us; we could have been more powerful. How bright we might have been, if only....
&lt;blockquote&gt;Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The wild men thought they were celebrating life, but really they were mourning it's decline. Is there anyone, we're starting to wonder, who is at peace with death when the end comes? Is there anything to be done?
&lt;blockquote&gt;Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Grave men, serious men, men of business and urgency, learn only at the end that they could have been happy. They "see with blinding sight" that "blind eyes" could "blaze like meteors and be gay", and for this reason they "rage against the dying of the light." The blind eyes blazing like meteors is something like poetic or artistic inspiration. You think of Homer's eyes, or Milton's. Or of Thomas's father, who was also going blind, and dying, when this poem was written (or perhaps he was already dead — I don't know). Now Thomas turns to the whole point of the poem; the address to his father.
&lt;blockquote&gt;And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. &lt;/blockquote&gt;"There on the sad height." Why does he imagine his father on a mountain top? It puts his father in a visionary position, a saintly position, a holy position, like Moses on Sinai or Horeb, or Christ on any of several mountains. "Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray": to me this is *the *line of the poem. Curse or blessing: Thomas doesn't care. What he wants is the connection, an end to being isolated from his father. But death itself puts his father "on the sad height." It's not Thomas's fault. Death isolates; it constrains the relationship to one of prayer, a holy and real relationship, sure, but one stripped of the sensual and the familiar and the homely.

And "your fierce tears." Ugh, that feels too real. How *hard *would it be to write that about a parent? It's no wonder Thomas takes the entire body of the poem to get to this point, *the *point. Now reread those refrains and see that they are full of passion and affection and grief and, yes, rage. Homeric rage, Achilles's rage. "Do not go gentle into that good night," Thomas says to his father. Sure, he's telling him (and us) how to hold his head high, but he's also just saying "Don't go. Don't do it." How *hard *would it be to write this poem?

The poem doesn't answer the question of how you should try to live. It systematically undercuts every way of life. Being good, being wild, being serious, being artistic: it doesn't matter. Nobody escapes. This is the quality of Dylan Thomas's rage. Far from a #YOLO poem, this is one of the most unflinching elegies ever written, written — it seems to me — from a place of terrible hurt. I've tried several times now to spin this poem into something positive, but I just can't. I can't read *Romeo and Juliet* as anything but a tragedy. I can't think about *La Boheme* without feeling terrifically sad. Making something positive out of it would feel fake. It would be like telling someone at a funeral to cheer up. Sometimes the poet just needs to say how sad he feels, and sometimes, readers, we just need to listen.

  <title type='text'>Dylan Thomas, Beavers, and 'Do not go gentle into that good night'</title>
  <content type='html'>If you follow the trendy bullshit closely, you'll know that this is the centenary of Dylan Thomas's birth. There have been a lot of bad articles about Thomas, and then there's &lt;a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n22/seamus-perry/everything-is-good-news" target="_blank"&gt;this very good one by Seamus Perry&lt;/a&gt;. One of my favorite passages from Perry's article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Most poetry begins, as Dryden said, with a confused mass of thoughts tumbling over one another in the dark; this was truer for Thomas than for most. He always insisted he wrote ‘out of words’ and not, like a realist novelist or a poet with an ideology to impart, ‘in the direction of them’. The words came first, and the business of writing a poem was the attempt to exercise some control on the multiple and mutually interfering ripples of possible meaning the words brought with them. It does not always come off, as even his keenest admirers would admit. I’m not sure anyone has ever cracked ‘All all and all’, a poem that grows dark with the effort of getting it ‘all’ in: ‘How now my flesh, my naked fellow,/Dug of the sea, the glanded morrow,/Worm in the scalp, the staked and fallow.’ And ‘Altarwise by Owl-Light’ must be the most sheerly difficult sonnet sequence ever written. Most of his great poems retain at least something of this formative confusion. He once said, portentously, in a response to a questionnaire, that ‘poetry must drag further into the clean nakedness of light more even of the hidden causes than Freud could realise’; but pellucid enlightenment is not the effect of most of his poems. Reading him we struggle through a dense verbal murkiness and then suddenly hear language realise itself in a line such as ‘And rivers of the dead around my neck’ or ‘When the worm builds with the gold straws of venom/My nest of mercies in the rude, red tree,’ or ‘the soft,/Unclenched, armless, silk and rough love that breaks all rocks.’ There are countless others.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Reading that makes me think about my own writing. I used to get frustrated with myself because I only half-understood my own writing. Unable to explain what the stuff meant, I felt like I must not be any good. But more and more, I'm understanding that understanding isn't so important. What matters in writing poetry is *&lt;b&gt;intuition, trusting yourself&lt;/b&gt;*. Last night I saw &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/leave-it-to-beavers/leave-it-to-beavers/8836/" target="_blank"&gt;an episode of *Nature* about beavers&lt;/a&gt;. I'm kind of fascinated by beaver dams. Beavers cut down trees and saw them up with their teeth and pile them up to build homes for their families. (On the show they give you a peek at a beaver family inside their dam, by the way, and it's just as adorable as you want it to be.) If I were being super-analytical I would ask, "Why did the beaver put this particular branch on this part of the dam? What's the full significance of this particular choice?" But it's more simple than that; the beaver is making what it can with what is has to hand. The construction of the dam is intimately tied to the beaver's immediate need and its immediate situation. Poets, likewise, live in a language. We have a need to create, and we have certain words and images and memories to hand. All art is, in a sense, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricolage" target="_blank"&gt;bricolage&lt;/a&gt;. What are we trying to dam up? What are we trying to protect? Who knows. All I know is that trying to thoroughly understand your own writing will ultimately lead to nothing but the Sisyphean task of understanding *who you are*. Any literary theory that doesn't take into account *what literature is*&amp;nbsp;ultimately ends up in the realm of philosophy, with literature nowhere in sight.

But back to Dylan Thomas. I've never been a big Dylan Thomas fan, and entirely for lack of trying. He's always struck me as a non-poet's poet, especially because of the popularity of &lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night" target="_blank"&gt;'Do not go gentle into that good night'&lt;/a&gt;. Kids in highschool liked the phrases "rage against the dying of the light" and "do not go gentle" because they sounded kind of metal. It always seems to be interpreted as something like&amp;nbsp;#YOLO, which bugs me. It's like Robert Frost's "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood," which so many people read as inspirational but, when you really read it carefully, is much too dark to be inspiring.

Also, 'Do not go gentle into that good night' is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanelle" target="_blank"&gt;villanelle&lt;/a&gt;, and I also just don't like villanelles all that much. The repetitions of whole lines come too quickly for my taste. The non-repeated lines feel like throwaways. Oh hell, in case you haven't read the poem in a while, here it is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.&lt;/blockquote&gt;There's just no time to talk more about this poem. I'll pick up with it tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/11/dylan-thomas-beavers-and-do-not-go.html" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F11%2Fdylan-thomas-beavers-and-do-not-go.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Variations on a Theme by William Carlos Williams' by Kenneth Koch</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;div class="tr_bq"&gt;I read this hilarious poem by Kenneth Koch on the train today, and I had to share it. I'll get back to writing about &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/search/label/Misty%20Poets" target="_blank"&gt;the Misty Poets&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow. I found the poem in this awesome collection by Robert Pinsky called *Singing School: Learning to Write (and Read) Poetry by Studying with the Masters*. For a long time I haven't been crazy about anthologies, but this book is turning me around on the idea.

OK, so the Kenneth Koch poem is a variation on the classic poem "This Is Just to Say" by William Carlos Williams. You might have read it in high school; I know that's where I first saw it. Here's the poem:

&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox

and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast

Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet
and so cold&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Throughout&amp;nbsp;*Singing School*, Robert&amp;nbsp;Pinsky offers a brief comment at the front of each poem. He calls Koch's poem "one of the greatest parodies ever," and I think he's right. OK, I'm done talking it up. Here's Kenneth Koch's "Variations on a Theme by William Carlos Williams":
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 1
I chopped down the house that you had been saving to live in next summer.
I am sorry, but it was morning, and I had nothing to do
and its wooden beams were so inviting.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 2
We laughed at the hollyhocks together
and then I sprayed them with lye.
Forgive me. I simply do not know what I am doing.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3
I gave away the money that you had been saving to live on for the next ten years.
The man who asked for it was shabby
and the firm March wind on the porch was so juicy and cold.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 4
Last evening we went dancing and I broke your leg.
Forgive me. I was clumsy and
I wanted you here in the wards, where I am the doctor!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://tinyurl.com/msokycf" data-text="Reading Kenneth Koch's hilarious variation on William Carlos Williams" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Fmsokycf&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Missed Time' by Ha Jin</title>
  <content type='html'>I'm going to continue my reading of &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/search/label/Misty%20Poets" target="_blank"&gt;the Misty Poets&lt;/a&gt; with a poem by Ha Jin. About a month ago I had the privilege of seeing Ha Jin, who I'm pretty sure lives here in Boston, read some selections from Dickinson and Yeats. (&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/robert-pinskys-voice.html" target="_blank"&gt;It was the same reading I saw Robert Pinsky read at.&lt;/a&gt;) I was really blown away by the intensity of Ha Jin's reading. You could really tell he was *thinking *the words as he read them. Reading them aloud, finding the right pace and inflection, was *the tangible form of his thought*. It's hard to describe, but it was a powerful difference between him and some of the other readers.

And I've been really happy to find that Ha Jin's own poems are equally powerful. I should have known, from the quality of Ha Jin's reading, that he would be a great writer.&amp;nbsp;You have to be a good reader, I think, to be a good writer. Here's a poem by Ha Jin &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/30111" target="_blank"&gt;from an old issue of&amp;nbsp;*Poetry*&lt;/a&gt;. I'm fascinated by this poem's title and how it might connect to the material. See if you can figure out why. Here's 'Missed Time':
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;My notebook has remained blank for months
thanks to the light you shower
around me. I have no use
for my pen, which lies
languorously without grief.

Nothing is better than to live
a storyless life that needs
no writing for meaning—
when I am gone, let others say
they lost a happy man,
though no one can tell how happy I was.

—&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/30111" target="_blank"&gt;Ha Jin, *Poetry*, July 2000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;First of all, I do believe this to a certain extent. Most writing comes out of anxiety. A life lived without having felt the need to write is a life lived free from all anxiety. There is "nothing better."

But is it real? Does such a life even exist? Can any human being live a "storyless life"? Doesn't this poem just reinforce, by the impossibility of the ideal life it illustrates, our knowledge that &lt;i style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;story and writing are what give life meaning, and that meaning is therefore a substitute for happiness? *Happiness itself is meaningless, and therefore unwritable. Story and writing come after happiness; they are a form&amp;nbsp;of grief.&lt;i style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; All writing is epitaph*. This, I think, is the reason for the title: 'Missed Time'. This poem is writable because the bliss it describes has already passed. There was a time of joy, once, and now that it's gone all the poet can do is write. (Indeed, this isn't the first time he's fallen from happiness: he owns a notebook and pen, after all!) Writing won't help, but it's all the poet can do, so he must do it. The impulse to write comes insistent like tears.

This poem should make us reconsider mourning and tears as a noble engagement with life. If life is so good, we should mourn it without shame. If we aren't mourning it with painting and music and poems, we probably aren't appreciating it enough. There are a lot of answers to the question, "Why write poems?" I think one of the best ones is implied in this poem: We write poems to commemorate the beauty and happiness that have passed from the world. Not because we hope to bring them back, not because others will experience that same happiness by hearing our poems, but because something must be done for the fallen.

Maybe I've missed the mark entirely in my reading of Ha Jin. An essay, after all, is an attempt. I'd rather shoot a thousand arrows and only one hit the mark than leave all my arrows in their quiver out of shame or fear or cowardice. And besides: we never know what our words may do. Maybe I've hit some mark I didn't even know was there. That story remains to be written.

  <title type='text'>'To the Oak' by Shu Ting </title>
  <content type='html'>This week I want to focus on the "Misty Poets." From Wikipedia:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Misty Poets&amp;nbsp;(Chinese:&amp;nbsp;朦胧诗人;&amp;nbsp;pinyin:&amp;nbsp;Ménglóng Shīrén)&amp;nbsp;are a group of 20th century&amp;nbsp;Chinese poets&amp;nbsp;who reacted against the restrictions on art during the&amp;nbsp;Cultural Revolution. They are so named because their work has been officially denounced as "obscure", "misty", or "hazy" poetry (menglong shi).&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words, they wrote against the officially sanctioned social realism so they were branded "misty." I love that they wear this insult as a badge of honor. Anti-realists might be a more fitting title in English; anti-social-realists would be even more exact. But "Misty Poets" will have to do.

The first poet I want to read is Shu Ting. I would have sworn I'd put one of her poems up here before, but looking through the blog now I don't see any of her work. I mentioned her in &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/painting-exhibition-by-xi-murong.html" target="_blank"&gt;my piece on Xi Murong's "Painting Exhibition"&lt;/a&gt;, but that's all. I love her work.
&lt;br/&gt;OK, enough prelude. Here's 'To the Oak', by Shu Ting:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Kapok_tree_Honolulu.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Kapok_tree_Honolulu.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If I love you
I won't imitate the morning glory
Borrowing your high branches to display myself;
if I love you
I won't imitate those infatuated birds
Who repeat their monotonous flattery to the foliage,
Nor the fountain
With its solace of cool waters;
I won't even be those background vistas
That serve to make you more majestic.
Not even sunshine,
Not even spring rain,
No, none of these!
I would like to be a kapok tree
Standing beside you as an equal,
Our roots touching underground,
Our leaves touching in the clouds;
&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NIqijVzZajQ/VFeVboJI7tI/AAAAAAAAAlA/IhiwonbNfqM/s1600/kapok-tree-323521_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NIqijVzZajQ/VFeVboJI7tI/AAAAAAAAAlA/IhiwonbNfqM/s1600/kapok-tree-323521_1280.jpg" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And with every gust of wind
We would bow to one another.
But no one else
Understands our language;
You have your branches
Like daggers or swords
While my big red flowers
Are like heavy sighs.
Though it seems we are separated forever
We are eternally together.
This is great love,
This is fidelity.
Love—
Not only for your splendid trunk
But also for the earth you stand on.

&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, Utopia, 'Palatino Linotype', Palatino, serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21.5599994659424px;"&gt;— &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse/149/5#!/20601005" target="_blank"&gt;Shu Ting, translated by Carolyn Kizer with Y.H. Zhao, *Poetry*, February 1987&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;There is, of course, an allegory at work. The Oak is some beloved person. The speaker turns the beloved into an allegorical figure and then asks, "Where do I belong in this allegory?" Shu Ting takes her time: The first half of the poem she spends saying what she *won't *be in the allegory. This gives her time and space to talk about *what love is not* in a rhetorical gesture that feels completely natural.

The speaker would like, in the allegory, to be a kapok tree. A tree, but not the same tree. Close to the oak, but separate from it. Having its own distinct ground, but sharing roots and canopies, a private and a public language. "Though it &lt;u&gt;seems&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;we are separated forever / We &lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;eternally together." It's about finding the right distance. Look back through the list of rejected images in the first half of the poem. They're always too close or too far. It's not a novel poem, by any means, but it's quiet and peaceful and meaningful and, in my view, quite perfect. &lt;b&gt;*The poem enriches and ennobles both nature and love by tying the two together conceptually*&lt;/b&gt;. Quite perfect.

  <title type='text'>Summing Up a Week of Ruefle</title>
  <content type='html'>So I've been reading Mary Ruefle and, as you know if you've been following along, absolutely loving her poetry. Here are links to my posts:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/bavaria-by-mary-ruefle.html" target="_blank"&gt;'Bavaria'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/blood-soup-by-mary-ruefle.html" target="_blank"&gt;'Blood Soup'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/keeping-it-simple-by-mary-ruefle.html" target="_blank"&gt;'Keeping it Simple'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/perpetually-attempting-to-soar-by-mary.html" target="_blank"&gt;'Perpetually Attempting to Soar'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/rain-effect-by-mary-ruefle.html" target="_blank"&gt;'Rain Effect'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;How to sum up? I can entreat you to buy Ruefle's books. I'm a big fan of supporting poets with your words and your dollars. Show the ones you love some love. Here are a few books worth checking out:

There's a lot more where that came from. Shop around for a good deal or check out your local library.

I'm going to have to make this a short post. Alas. I just don't have any energy right now. Have a happy Halloween and great weekend, all!

  <title type='text'>"Rain Effect" by Mary Ruefle</title>
  <content type='html'>Ah yes: another amazing poem from Mary Ruefle. I love when you can dig deeper and deeper into a poet's work and you just find more and more treasures. When you have that sense of communion with a poet, the sense that they see things the same way you do, the sense that they are able to open up worlds for you because they're coming from the same direction you are, the sense that by getting to know the poet better you're getting to better know *yourself*: that's a feeling you have to chase. So, that said, here's "Rain Effect" by Mary Ruefle. Pay attention to the movement of the the progression of sensations. And be on the lookout for a big leap. We had &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/perpetually-attempting-to-soar-by-mary.html" target="_blank"&gt;a big leap in yesterday's poem&lt;/a&gt;; actually, now that I think about it, all the Ruefle poems I've looked at have had a big leap, a moment when the poem breaks into a very different B section, to borrow a term from music. Keep your eye open for another here. Here's "Rain Effect":
&lt;blockquote&gt;A bride and a groom sitting in an open buggy
in the rain, holding hands but not looking
at each other, waiting for the rain to stop,
waiting for the marriage to begin, embarrassed
by the rain, the effect of the rain on the bridal
veil, the wet horse with his mane in his eyes,
the rain cold as the sea, the sea deep as love,
big drops of rain falling on the leather seat,
the rain beaded on a rose pinned to the groom’s
lapel, the rain on the bride’s bouquet,
on the baby’s breath there, the sound of the rain
hitting the driver’s top hat, the rain
shining like satin on the black street,
on the tips of patent leather shoes, Hokusai’s
father who polished mirrors for a living, Hokusai’s
father watching the sky for clouds, Hokusai’s father’s son
drawing rain over a bridge and over the people crossing
the bridge, Hokusai’s father’s son drawing the rain
for hours, Hokusai’s father rubbing a mirror, the rain
cold as the sea, the sea cold as love, the sea swelling
to a tidal wave, at the tip of the wave white.

— text from &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/238940" target="_blank"&gt;the Poetry Foundation website&lt;/a&gt;. They have a footnote: "Mary Ruefle, “Rain Effect” from *Cold Pluto*. Copyright © 1996 by Mary Ruefle. Reprinted by permission of Carnegie Mellon University Press." &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/17/21879895_4da82b7615_z.jpg?zz=1" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="275" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/17/21879895_4da82b7615_z.jpg?zz=1" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First, the form. The whole poem is one long sentence. But no, it's not even that. There's no main verb, so it's just one long fragment that's punctuated helpfully/deceptively like a sentence.

If she hadn't written anything from that first "Hokusai" to the end, Ruefle would still have written a beautiful poem. But from "Hokusai" forward we've made the big leap. We've engaged with that *principle of juxtaposition*&amp;nbsp;that makes Ruefle's poems work. They feel (to me) like &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=joseph+cornell+boxes&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;biw=1680&amp;amp;bih=882&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=GWFSVI3oFIn_yQTc-4Fg&amp;amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg" target="_blank"&gt;Joseph Cornell's boxes&lt;/a&gt;. Because two unlike things are yoked together, we must do what we can to make sense of them as a whole. If we don't, if we can't, we have to reevaluate our sense of what it is artists do. (This same idea is taken a step further by poets who yoke together unlike grammatical and typographical objects to make us reevaluate our sense of what it is *language* does. This seems like a fine enough idea, to me, but a poor foundation for good poetry.)

So how would you relate the A section to the B section. Is the A section the content of a painting by Hokusai? It would seem so, which means that the careful attention to detail, the slow movement from detail to detail is that of Hokusai himself. And yet, these aren't really *painterly*&amp;nbsp;details, are they? The sights are, sure, but the sounds and the thoughts are more of a writer's territory. What's Ruefle doing here? Is it a critique of painting's limitations? Or is she rather opening up our conception of what goes into a painting?

And what about this other detail of Hokusai's father, the mirror maker? How does his polishing the mirror tie in? I would venture the guess that we're supposed to draw a connection between the polishing of the mirror (making a thing perfect for seeing oneself) and the detailed attention to the painting (making a thing perfect for seeing the world). They are one and the same activity. Like father like son. Perhaps this is why Ruefle insists on using the awkward phrasing "Hokusai's father's son."

And then "the tip of the wave white." I don't even know where to start. This is probably a reference to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokusai#mediaviewer/File:Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa2.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;Hokusai's most famous painting&lt;/a&gt;, but why reference it? What does it add to the meaning?

One last Mary Ruefle poem tomorrow. Until then!

  <title type='text'>“Perpetually Attempting to Soar” by Mary Ruefle</title>
  <content type='html'>Today I'm going to read more from Mary Ruefle. As in the last two posts (&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/blood-soup-by-mary-ruefle.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/keeping-it-simple-by-mary-ruefle.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) I'm accessing poems through &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/browse/poets" target="_blank"&gt;the Poetry Foundation website&lt;/a&gt;, so many thanks are due to them for providing such an amazing resource for poetry readers. OK, let's get to it. Here's "Perpetually Attempting to Soar" by Mary Ruefle:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A boy from Brooklyn used to cruise on summer nights.
As soon as he’d hit sixty he’d hold his hand out the window,
cupping it around the wind. He’d been assured
this is exactly how a woman’s breast feels when you put
your hand around it and apply a little pressure. Now he knew,
and he loved it. Night after night, again and again, until
the weather grew cold and he had to roll the window up.
For many years afterwards he was perpetually attempting
to soar. One winter’s night, holding his wife’s breast
in his hand, he closed his eyes and wanted to weep.
He loved her, but it was the wind he imagined now.
As he grew older, he loved the word etcetera and refused
to abbreviate it. He loved sweet white butter. He often
pretended to be playing the organ. On one of his last mornings,
he noticed the shape of his face molded in the pillow.
He shook it out, but the next morning it reappeared.

—From &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/240612" target="_blank"&gt;the Poetry Foundation website &lt;/a&gt;. Mary Ruefle, “Perpetually Attempting to Soar” from *Cold Pluto*. Copyright © 1996 by Mary Ruefle. Reprinted by permission of Carnegie Mellon University Press. " &lt;/blockquote&gt;Not all of Ruefle's poems are narratives, but when they are they really do it for me. Like &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/keeping-it-simple-by-mary-ruefle.html" target="_blank"&gt;the poem I read yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, this poem is about abstraction. "The boy from Brooklyn" infers a sexual experience from a mundane experience. "Now he knew, / and he loved it." He knew what? The feel of a woman's breast, he tells himself. "He's been assured" that's what it feels like. "Night after night, again and again" — it's a comical inversion of the teenage boy taking a girl out in his car. It's just him and the wind — "night after night, again and again." If I were a university professor I would tell you this poem is about masturbation.

Then there's a phrase that tries to sum it all up before moving the next phase of the poem. "For many years afterwards he was perpetually attempting / to soar." He tries to move fast enough to feel the wind. That's the soaring that's going on, I think. For many years he tries to experience things through simulation. "Attempting" is a good word. It's got that sense of failure to it, that sense of *almost but not quite*, and it has the word "tempt" hidden inside.

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9F-heOTUXZU/VFDqT7pcg-I/AAAAAAAAAj0/2RsgKqX_mP0/s1600/Narcissus-Caravaggio_(1594-96)_edited.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9F-heOTUXZU/VFDqT7pcg-I/AAAAAAAAAj0/2RsgKqX_mP0/s1600/Narcissus-Caravaggio_(1594-96)_edited.jpg" height="320" width="264" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Then we have a leap. Our hero finds (we don't know how much time has elapsed) that the real thing just isn't enough. He feels his wife's breast and wishes for the wind. The roles are reversed. After all those years of attempting to soar, he finds he prefers the representation of reality to the reality itself. There's a sharp protest in that "He loved her, but...." If he "loves" "the word etcetera" and "butter" then how much does he really "love" his wife? Some love! Then comes the phrase that sums it all up: "He often / pretended to be playing the organ." He's not a creator; he's not really *in* life. He's just pretending. He's pretending "often." Where's that young man who went out driving alone? Right here, still preferring the substitute to the reality. Boys in their cars: we often use this as a symbol of a young lust for life, but Ruefle shows that it's more complex than that.

"On one of his last mornings...." The narrative draws so quickly to its close! It's heavy with mortality. "He noticed the shape of his face molded in the pillow. / He shook it out, but the next morning it reappeared." &lt;b&gt;*The man who prefers abstractions to realities is disturbed by the fact that he is a reality that can be abstracted*&lt;/b&gt;. Looking at his own abstraction is a realization of — consummation of — his own mortality. He's fascinated — bewitched — by the image of himself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissus_(mythology)" target="_blank"&gt;It is the myth of Narcissus&lt;/a&gt;. The professor is clearing his throat and giving you that *told you so*&amp;nbsp;look.

Maybe I'm wrong. But it's where my mind led me this morning. It's where the poem led my mind this morning. Tomorrow it may take me somewhere else. I look forward to it.

Also, here's &lt;a href="http://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2014/10/20/what-were-reading-in-october/" target="_blank"&gt;a short article I contributed to, which includes a brief paragraph on Merwin&lt;/a&gt;. In short, I loved this book. You should definitely check it out of your library or buy yourself a copy or steal your friend's copy ASAP.

Much love,

Tim

Rather than complain that Twitter posts and many blogs are too cursory and too canonical in their coverage of poetry, I'm going to counteract the offending trendings and write a slower, more concentrated review about a new book of poetry: W.S. Merwin's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Moon-Before-Morning-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;*The Moon Before Morning*&lt;/a&gt;. Over the course of this week I want to focus on a few key aspects of Merwin's newest book, including his renunciation of punctuation, the arrangement of the poems within the book, and the poetic forms he chooses.

But today I just want to gather some information about Merwin into one place. You might have noticed that many of my readings lean toward the New Critical school of thinking: I read the poem as a self-contained unit, rarely going into a poem's or poet's historical context in a way that might inform my reading of a text. But that, I'm afraid, is more out of laziness than ideology. I don't believe in the great Tradition, but at times I read like someone who does. Let's counteract that.

*&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Moon-Before-Morning-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;The Moon Before Morning&lt;/a&gt; *is Merwin's fourteenth book with &lt;a href="https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/pages/browse/author.asp?ag={5D7D8EE9-7AC6-473F-91DA-F8CCDE1A1B98}" target="_blank"&gt;Copper Canyon Press&lt;/a&gt;; he's been publishing with them for just over twenty years now, though much more prolifically in the last decade. I like Copper Canyon's two paragraph bio, so here it is:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;W.S. &lt;span data-scayt_word="Merwin" data-scaytid="1"&gt;Merwin&lt;/span&gt; was  born in New York City in 1927 and was United States Poet Laureate in  2010. He graduated from Princeton University in 1948, where he studied  with John &lt;span data-scayt_word="Berryman" data-scaytid="2"&gt;Berryman&lt;/span&gt; and R.P. &lt;span data-scayt_word="Blackmur" data-scaytid="3"&gt;Blackmur&lt;/span&gt;. From 1949 to 1951 he worked as a tutor in France, &lt;span data-scayt_word="Mallorca" data-scaytid="4"&gt;Mallorca&lt;/span&gt;,  and Portugal; for several years afterward he made the greater part of  his living by translating from French, Spanish, Latin, and Portuguese.  His first book of poetry, *A Mask for Janus* (1952) was selected by W.H. &lt;span data-scayt_word="Auden" data-scaytid="7"&gt;Auden&lt;/span&gt; for the Yale Younger Poets Prize.

Since then, &lt;span data-scayt_word="Merwin" data-scaytid="5"&gt;Merwin&lt;/span&gt; has authored dozens of books of poetry and prose. His work embodies a  bold commitment to experimentation and transformation rooted in the  moral necessity of bearing witness, and is influenced by his profoundly  environmentalist, pacifist, and anti–imperialist beliefs.&amp;nbsp;He has  won&amp;nbsp;many awards, as well as fellowships from the Rockefeller and the  Guggenheim Foundations and the National Endowment for the Arts. W.S. &lt;span data-scayt_word="Merwin" data-scaytid="6"&gt;Merwin&lt;/span&gt; has lived in Hawaii since 1976.

— taken whole-cloth from &lt;a href="https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/pages/browse/author.asp?ag=%7B5D7D8EE9-7AC6-473F-91DA-F8CCDE1A1B98%7D" target="_blank"&gt;Copper Canyon's website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;That last, tiny sentence is terribly important. Merwin and his poetry are inextricably bound to Hawaii. He isn't just a poet who writes about the environment; he's a committed environmentalist who practices what he preaches on his three acre palm plantation on Maui. From the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704604704576220602720997650" target="_blank"&gt;Wall Street Journal's profile&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Mr. Merwin's path to his palm forest was an indirect one. The son of a  Presbyterian minister, he was born in New York, lived in France and then  came to Hawaii in the 1970s to study Zen Buddhism. Not long after  arriving, he heard of a small piece of land near the coast with a small  cabin, the place where three native Hawaiian activists had hidden after  defying the U.S. Navy and occupying the bombed island of Kaho`olawe.
...
Using his small inheritance, he spent $60,000 or so for just over three  acres in 1977. With little money left, he drew plans for the house, and  recruited friends and local craftsmen to help him build it.
...
&lt;div style="font-size: 15px;"&gt;At first, Mr. Merwin said, he had somewhat  "naively" hoped to restore a rain forest with native plants. But the  soil was so leached and the conditions so dry and wind-swept that he  found the only ones that thrived were Hawaiian Pritchardias, a type of  palm. He estimates he now has more than 850 different species of palms  on the property, including a few he's saved from extinction, such as  Hyophorbe indica from Reunion Island.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-size: 15px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-size: 15px;"&gt;In  2010, shortly before Mr. Merwin agreed to become the poet laureate, the  couple created the Merwin Conservancy, preserving the home and the palm  forest and receiving nonprofit status as a retreat for writers and  botanists. "William has created one of the greatest palm collections in  the world," said Charles R. "Chipper" Wichman, director of the National  Tropical Botanical Gardens. "It is amazing."

— Julia Flynn Siler, the Wall Street Journal, March 25, 2011&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Merwin's piece of Hawaii and its progression over the decades is the subject of most of* &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Moon-Before-Morning-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;The Moon Before Morning&lt;/a&gt;*. There is a calm and a magic to the poems that makes you understand* *why Merwin fell in love with the place. Nothing is more important than the place, including time. This loyalty to place enforces a powerful simplicity and economy. Like Ezra Pound, Merwin is a man who *knows* poetry and language, yet we see hardly any of it here. He refuses to wear his learning on his sleeve. &lt;b&gt;*Merwin's withdrawal from the West and the East to an island between is perfectly emblematic of his poetry*&lt;/b&gt;. It is a withdrawal into Nature, into the self, into the quiet things that persist when no one else is watching or listening, into things that are always true. I'm a lifelong reader of Henry David Thoreau's *Walden*; is it any wonder this collection appeals to me?

I have the craziest damn day ahead of me, so unfortunately I just don't have time to do any writing. Here's some good stuff to read to familiarize yourself with W.S. Merwin's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Moon-Before-Morning-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;*The Moon Before Morning*&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/22/moon-before-morning-ws-merwin-beautiful" target="_blank"&gt;Fiona Sampson's excellent review at *The Guardian*.&lt;/a&gt; If you only read one of these articles, make it this one.

&lt;a href="http://www.kansas.com/entertainment/books/article2101981.html" target="_blank"&gt;Arlice Davenport's paean to Merwin in the Wichita Eagle&lt;/a&gt;. I find terms like 'greatest living poet' unhelpful; people who use the term are leaning toward the idea of priesthood. (Last line: "May he keep blessing us with his superlative gift for many more years to come.") But, still, Davenport seems to have read the book well and gotten some of the main points.

&lt;a href="http://therumpus.net/2014/09/the-moon-before-morning-by-w-s-merwin/" target="_blank"&gt;Camden Avery's excessively lyrical review on The Rumpus&lt;/a&gt;. Writing about poetry doesn't require writing poetic prose.

&lt;a href="http://poetsatwork.org/poetry-book-reviews/w-s-merwins-the-moon-before-morning/" target="_blank"&gt;Timothy Liu's snarky review on Poets At Work&lt;/a&gt;. I'm all for negative reviews, but this one is regrettably mean-spirited, and Liu gives away at several points that he hasn't been reading carefully. &amp;lt;Sigh&amp;gt;

Happy reading, happy hunting, happy birthday, etc. etc. etc. Until tomorrow, all.

*Stichic integrity*. I learned this term from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brian-Turner/e/B001K7X8VU" target="_blank"&gt;Brian Turner, author of two excellent poetry collections and a new memoir&lt;/a&gt;. If you Google *stichic integrity *you'll find &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2006/02/journal-day-two-23/" target="_blank"&gt;this article by Turner&lt;/a&gt;, in which he describes how, when writing and editing his own poetry, "each line [*needs*] to be considered in isolation for its own strengths and weaknesses." Each line needs to stand on its own two feet.

(Fun fact: *stichos* — "stich" pronounced like "stick", "os" as in "cost" —,* *is Ancient Greek for "line" or "verse.")

But this doesn't mean that a line&amp;nbsp; has to be a single sentence or idea. This confused me for a long time. A line's strength can come from playful ambiguity. Here's Turner from that same &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2006/02/journal-day-two-23/" target="_blank"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I like to call some lines ‘wrap-around’ lines. It’s when two phrases  cohabitate on the same line. For example: “on a sidewalk, a blistered  hand’s gold ring.” That line, for me, has stichic integrity because the  two parts play off of each other. The *blistered hand’s gold ring* can be read as existing *on the sidewalk*. In the very next line after that (*still shining, while a medic, Doc Lopez*) Doc Lopez can be read to be still *shining*. Basically, there is an interplay of meaning, an exchange of relationships, built into the positioning of phrases themselves. &lt;/blockquote&gt;By placing the tail of one phrase onto the same line as the head of another phrase, Turner allows their meanings to intermingle. This preserves the logical sense (we can follow natural English sentences rather than puzzle over fragments) while allowing room for the reader's imagination to play. It slows you down and rewards imaginative reading.

W.S. Merwin accomplishes something similar throughout *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moon-Before-Morning-W-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;The Moon Before Morning&lt;/a&gt;* by giving you just the lines with no guides or cues for how he wants you to read them. There's no punctuation to guide your breath; often there are no stanza breaks to show you where one section ends and another begins. It's just the lines on the page and you. I'll give you a brief example from the first poem in the collection, "Homecoming":
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Once only when the summer
was nearly over and my own
hair had been white as the day's clouds&lt;/blockquote&gt;Let's stop right there. The first line is a little bumpy "Once only when": we might reasonably expect a small pause after "only". Then take the two first two lines together: "Once only when the summer / was nearly over and my own." This could work; that "the summer was... my own" is a little heavy-handedly poetic, but it could work. He could begin the story now. But the "my own" carries over to "hair" and we see that the thought spills over the line. We thought it was over, but it kept going. Does that mean the "summer was ... my own" reading is invalid now? *&lt;b&gt;Logically, yes; Imaginatively, no&lt;/b&gt;*. Now it's richer, more ambiguous, more meaningful thanks to its arbitrary positioning between "summer" and "hair". Let's try again:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Once only when the summer
was nearly over and my own
hair had been white as the day's clouds
for more years than I was counting
I looked across the garden at evening&lt;/blockquote&gt;Just look at that fourth line and how well it fits with both the line-and-a-half that precede it ("my own hair had been white as the day's clouds // for more years than I was counting") and the line that follows it ("for more years than I was counting // I looked across the garden at evening"). Time flows in many directions; the arrangement of lines controls it, but only just.

Notice also that a new section has begun with "I looked across the garden." There's a heavy pause after "counting," the first really heavy pause of the poem. What a perfect word to pause at, especially in the first poem of the collection when we're just learning how the poet counts his lines! The first four lines have been establishing setting and character, and with the fifth line we begin the action. Here's the rest of the poem:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Once only when the summer
was nearly over and my own
hair had been white as the day's clouds
for more years than I was counting
I looked across the garden at evening
Paula was still weeding around
flowers that open after dark
and I looked up at the clear sky
and saw the new moon and at that
moment from behind me a band
of dark birds and then another
after it flying in silence
long curving wings hardly moving
the plovers just in from the sea
and the flight clear from Alaska
half their weight gone to get them home
but home now arriving without
a sound as it rose to meet them

"Homecoming", W.S. Merwin, *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moon-Before-Morning-W-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;The Moon Before Morning&lt;/a&gt;*, Copper Canyon Press, ©2014, p.5  &lt;/blockquote&gt;You sense the pauses now? The way each line both does and doesn't flow into the one after it? Think about it in terms of stichic integrity. You become *responsible *for the poem, and this responsibility slows you down and makes you experience the peaceful scene the poetic speaker himself is witnessing. I love the heavy pause after "silence" in the twelfth line, and the powerful slowness of the line that follows: "long curving wings hardly moving". And then "moving" takes or seems to take "the plovers" as its direct object, so we know we can't stop. "Hardly moving", yes, but moving all the same. The thought settles into a shape (a line) and then — by the pressure of its desire to keep going — breaks itself. Masterful. Isn't that the word?

We're going to end with four posts about W.S. Merwin's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moon-Before-Morning-W-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;*The Moon Before Midnight*&lt;/a&gt; rather than five. Why? Really it's this: yesterday I found a little time to slow down and relax, and I took it.

I've been too stressed out lately. I'm basically working my day job, a medium-sized job on the side, a smaller job on the side, and writing this blog. And now I've been asked to do another blog for a much more demanding audience. It's crazy. It's fun, and fulfilling, and makes me more hopeful for my future than I've been in quite a while, but it's crazy.&amp;nbsp;

But enough about me. Let's get back to Merwin. I want to talk briefly about form. &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/ws-merwins-moon-before-morning-book_24.html" target="_blank"&gt;Looking at the poem 'Homecoming' on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, I stressed the poem's amorphous quality, and how we seemed to be allowed to read both backward and forward in a way that allowed us to experience the subjective aspects of time even while feeling the irresistible forward motion of decay/desire. OK, sure: amorphous-ness. But there was some form to it, wasn't there? Divide it into four-line groups. Look how they begin: "Once ... I looked ... and saw ... long curving wings hardly moving ... but home now arriving." The poem can be broken into logical units; it's important that it isn't, but it's also important that it can be.

So what other forms does Merwin use in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moon-Before-Morning-W-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;*The Moon Before Morning*&lt;/a&gt;, and how does he use those forms, and how does he resist other forms?

The second poem is a lovely sort of haiku, though it doesn't follow the normal metrical rules of haiku. I'll go ahead and share that one since it's so — wow.
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Rain through the morning
and in the long pool a toad singing
happiness old as water

— "By the Front Door", W.S. Merwin, *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moon-Before-Morning-W-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;The Moon Before Morning&lt;/a&gt;*, Copper Canyon Press, ©2014, p.6  &lt;/blockquote&gt;Just really quickly: whenever you notice somebody singing or playing music in a poem, especially if it's toward the beginning of a long poem or the beginning of a collection, the poet is probably talking about her- or himself as a poet. It's a very *meta *gesture. Even the title feels meta — how can "By the Front Door" not be a sly reference to the beginning of the book, just as "Homecoming" was? It's a common gesture. Virgil did it. Dante did it. &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/dream-song-1-by-john-berryman.html" target="_blank"&gt;John Berryman did it&lt;/a&gt;. A million poets have done it. Merwin's doing it here. Merwin is the toad; the toad is Merwin. He welcomes the comparison. The littleness of the poet in the poem is matched by the unassuming littleness of the poem itself. And isn't the toad teaching us, in this little poem where we have to add such heavy pauses at the end of each line, exactly how we ought to be reading these poems, and this book as a whole?

For me, the shorter poems are the best ones in this book. When Merwin uses longer forms he becomes more generic, more common. But as a whole, the book is a strong one. It's one of the rare books that I'll actually go out and buy a copy of, because I would be glad and proud to have it on my shelf.

I have to start wrapping this up. Isn't this ridiculous? I've written so many words about *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moon-Before-Morning-W-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;The Moon Before Morning&lt;/a&gt;* now and yet I still feel like I haven't said anything at all. I've learned from the process — some of the things I've written here so matter-of-factly I only *learned through the act of writing *them. Writing here on this blog is a very associative process for me; it's so easygoing that I feel guilty about it sometimes. But whatever. I'm not an academic. This isn't for a literary journal. This is a fun place. A relaxed place. It's good I took that day off, because I needed a little down-time to remember that. I look forward to coming back next week.

Have a good weekend, all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/review-of-ws-merwins-moon-before-morning.html" data-text="W.S.

  <title type='text'>"Keeping it Simple" by Mary Ruefle</title>
  <content type='html'>I want to continue reading Mary Ruefle this week. Here's a great short poem of hers, &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/mary-ruefle#poet" target="_blank"&gt;available on the Poetry Foundation website&lt;/a&gt;. "Keeping it Simple":
&lt;blockquote&gt;I take the bird on the woodpile,
separate it from its function, feather
by feather. I blow up its scale.
I make a whole life out of it:
everywhere I am, its sense of loitering
lights on my shoulder.

—From &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/238536" target="_blank"&gt;the Poetry Foundation website &lt;/a&gt;. They have a footnote: "Mary Ruefle, “Keeping It Simple” from *memling’s veil*, published by University of Alabama Press. Copyright © 1982 by Mary Ruefle. Reprinted by permission of the author."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Let's keep the interpretation simple. She sees a bird, she observes the bird, she emulates the bird. Good? Can we all agree on this? The bird is a model of simplicity. Easy peasy.

No, sorry, I can't agree to that. There's *always *more to see. Look at some of the key words. What's a key word? A word that makes you slow down. Meanings gather there. Words like "on the" and "from its" just slide by (which is not to say that they're unimportant) but words like "woodpile" and "function" just *demand *more attention. The *most *important word is... well, what do you think it is? I'll show my cards soon. It's only six lines, so let's just take it a bit at a time.
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I take the bird on the woodpile,
separate it from its function, feather
by feather. I blow up its scale.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So we have an observer, and we have a bird being observed. There's a woodpile, "the" woodpile, probably a woodpile outside the observer's home. Then the observer takes a psychological leap by separating the bird "from its function." It's violent. The bird is being torn apart "feather by feather" until all that remains is the idea of a bird, the mythic shape of bird-ness. The phrase "I blow up" is taken from photography, of course, but there's also a latent meaning of violent explosion. The bird's natural size is unnaturally increased, and so the natural is blown up, eradicated.

&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0817300945/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0817300945&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=K6VRD3HENMCYP7DS" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=0817300945&amp;amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20" height="400" width="265" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What does "function" mean here? I'm going to guess it means *the bird's symbolic place in the observer's life, the way the image of the bird fits into the observer's imagination*. Every observer — all of us — contains an imaginarium, a set of images we've been collecting all our lives. We do the same thing with words, too: we collect them in long strings. Every new instance of "bird" that we encounter — whether a bird we see in the real world, drawn in the pages of a book, or written in English or Chinese or whatever — adds to and transforms and is transformed by all our previous experiences of "bird". The speaker/observer here is taking an individual instance of bird and *by careful observation *("feather by feather")&amp;nbsp;abstracting it until all she has is the idea, the image from her imaginarium. She's venturing inside herself *through the portal of the world, through the world as portal*.
&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0817300945" height="1" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I make a whole life out of it:
everywhere I am, its sense of loitering
lights on my shoulder.&lt;/blockquote&gt;She abstracts an ethics from that idea, a way of life. It's not a bird that "lights" on her shoulder, but the idea of the bird, the ethics implied by the bird. And what ethical stance does the bird exemplify? Well, it's the most important word in the poem, of course: "loitering." Loiter is such an amazing word. Whenever I hear "loiter" I think of Walt Whitman. Here's 'Beginning my Studies':
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;BEGINNING my studies, the first step pleas’d me so much,
The mere fact, consciousness—these forms—the power of motion,
The least insect or animal—the senses—eyesight—love;
The first step, I say, aw’d me and pleas’d me so much,
I have hardly gone, and hardly wish’d to go, any farther,
But stop and loiter all the time, to sing it in extatic songs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;And I think of this story from Henry David Thoreau's *Walden*:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I once had a sparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment, while I was hoeing in a village garden, and I felt that I was more distinguished by that circumstance that I should have been by any epaulet I could have worn.&lt;/blockquote&gt;And of course I think of these words from the Gospel of Matthew:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?&amp;nbsp;Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life? "And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The poetic life, the "whole life" that the observer made out of this abstracting process, is one of ease and loitering. Not that there aren't trials and troubles; but the whole life comes through being at ease *within oneself*. The bird alighting on your shoulder is a sign that you are at peace. It's a sign of *grace*, take that word however you will. And a bird may not alight on your shoulder every day, but "its sense of loitering" can.

There's so much I'm not saying. There's no time. Maybe tomorrow's poem will bring out more. Until tomorrow, all.

  <title type='text'>'Blood Soup' by Mary Ruefle</title>
  <content type='html'>I want to pick up again with reading Mary Ruefle this week. I read the poem &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/bavaria-by-mary-ruefle.html" target="_blank"&gt;'Bavaria'&lt;/a&gt; a couple weeks ago, which I found on&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/238938" target="_blank"&gt;the Poetry Foundation website&lt;/a&gt;, so let's keep moving through those poems and look at&amp;nbsp;'Blood Soup'.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The last time I saw father alive he was using
a black umbrella, closed, to beat off some pigeons
hanging outside the marble portals of a museum.
We were visitors, walking very slowly, so father
could stoop and examine everything. We had not been
in the museum, but were resting on its steps.
We saw it all—the fountains, the statues, the parks
and the post office. Cities are made of such things.
Once we encountered a wedding coming out of the cathedral
and were caught in a shower of rice; as the bride
flicked her veiled head father licked his little finger
and in this way saved a grain. On the next block
he announced he was going to heaven. But first let’s
go back to the hotel and rest, he said: I want my mint.
Those were practically his last words. And what did I want
more than anything in the world? Probably the ancient Polish
recipe for blood soup, which was finally told to me
in an empty deli in a deserted mill town in western Massachusetts
by the owner’s mother, who was alone one day when I burst
in and demanded a bowl. But, she said, lacing her fingers
around a jar of morello cherries, it requires one cup of
new blood drawn from the goose whose neck you’ve just wrung
to put in the pot, and where in these days can I find
anything as fresh as that? I had lost track of my life
before, but nothing prepared me for the onslaught of
wayfarer’s bliss when she continued to list, one
by one, the impossible ingredients I needed to live.
We sat at the greasy table far into the night, while
snow fell on the locked doors of the church next door,
dedicated to St. Stanislas, which was rumored to be
beautiful inside, and contain the remains of his beloved head.

—From &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/238938" target="_blank"&gt;the Poetry Foundation website&lt;/a&gt;. They have a footnote: "Mary Ruefle, 'Blood Soup' from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Among-Musk-People-Mary-Ruefle/dp/0887483674" target="_blank"&gt;*Among the Musk Ox People: Poems*&lt;/a&gt;. Copyright © 2002 by Mary Ruefle. Reprinted by permission of Carnegie Mellon University Press."&lt;/blockquote&gt;I love the narrative quality of the poem. It reminds me of &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/homage-by-noelle-kocot.html" target="_blank"&gt;that poem by Noelle Kocot that I read a couple months ago&lt;/a&gt;. There are two stories, and their connection isn't forced. I love that style; plain language, nothing baroque, working on a principle of juxtaposition. Take two separate things, put them in the same container, and let the imagination play: it's like &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=joseph+cornell&amp;amp;es_sm=93&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=ZEpOVMTQHcaAygTLhILgAw&amp;amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;amp;biw=1680&amp;amp;bih=949#tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=joseph%20cornell%20shadow%20boxes&amp;amp;revid=1973939368&amp;amp;imgdii=_" target="_blank"&gt;a Joseph Cornell box&lt;/a&gt;.

Images echo eachother. There are two churches: there's the "wedding coming out of the cathedral" in the middle and "the church next door / dedicated to St. Stanislaus" toward the end. There's the shower of rice outside the cathedral, and there's the snow falling outside the church. Then notice this one: in the middle we have "as the bride / flicked her veiled &lt;u&gt;head father&lt;/u&gt; licked his little finger" and at the end we have "the remains of his &lt;u&gt;beloved head&lt;/u&gt;." All of these tie back to the museum that the speaker hadn't been inside, she and her father on the steps. They're always outside of things, always just getting caught up in somebody else's celebration, always hearing rumors of the thing without seeing the thing itself, always playing the role of the "visitor" or the "wayfarer". It's almost like we're hearing the same story several times over.

There's such a fairy tale quality to the second half of the poem. The speaker "burst / in and demanded a bowl" of blood soup. That's such a strangely *active *way of putting it. It's heroic.&amp;nbsp;But the ingredients are impossible. "[W]here *in these days*&amp;nbsp;can I find / anything as fresh as that?" (emphasis my own). That gesture of tiredness, exhaustion, displacement from a more magical time, tells us so much about the speaker. It's such an amazing passage. "I had lost track of my life / before, but nothing prepared me for the onslaught of / wayfarer's bliss when she continued to list, one / by one, the impossible ingredients I needed to live." The old polish woman, the deli owner's mother, might as well be a witch at her cauldron. She demands blood. Is the speaker, by recalling the last moments of her father's life, giving the witch the demanded blood? Is she wringing the neck of the goose, just as St. Stanislas has had his head removed, just as she is making her father die all over again?

I might be over-reaching. But that's all part of it, right? I'll be back with more Mary Ruefle tomorrow. Until then!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/blood-soup-by-mary-ruefle.html" data-text="Reading 'Blood Soup' by Mary Ruefle" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F10%2Fblood-soup-by-mary-ruefle.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Emily Dickinson, #70: "So bashful when I spied her"</title>
  <content type='html'>Let's cap off the week with one last Emily Dickinson poem. Here's #70: "So bashful when I spied her" —  &lt;blockquote&gt;SO bashful when I spied her, &lt;br/&gt;So pretty, so ashamed! &lt;br/&gt;So hidden in her leaflets, &lt;br/&gt;Lest anybody find; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So breathless till I passed her,&lt;br/&gt;So helpless when I turned &lt;br/&gt;And bore her, struggling, blushing, &lt;br/&gt;Her simple haunts beyond! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For whom I robbed the dingle, &lt;br/&gt;For whom betrayed the dell, &lt;br/&gt;Many will doubtless ask me, &lt;br/&gt;But I shall never tell!&lt;/blockquote&gt; In &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/emily-dickinson-144-i-never-hear-word.html"&gt;the last Dickinson poem I looked at&lt;/a&gt;, there speaker struggled toward freedom. Here, the speaker is carrying someone off — unwillingly, it seems. Rapture is a very safe way of putting it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first two stanzas strike me as fairly straightforward narrative. A man spies a bookish girl (bookish because she's "hidden in her leaflets") or possibly an animal or a girl hiding in the woods (the leaflets, after all, might just be small leaves). The riddle begins in the third stanza. What does the speaker mean "for whom"? I can understand that by taking the girl/animal the speaker has "robbed the dingle" and "betrayed the dell", but why would I ask "for whom" he did it? He did it for himself, didn't he? What other hand could have been at work?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I want to allegorize this poem to make some sense of it, but I don't know how. I mentioned &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/emily-dickinson-26-its-all-i-have-to.html"&gt;in reading #26&lt;/a&gt; that I found it interesting that there was no loss. I wanted to read sacrifice into the poetry, but really there was just presentation. The living world was preserved by poetry, allowed to live as it wanted to. That's definitely not the case in this poem. The speaker comes in and take, disrupts, causes fear and panic and — blushing. Rapture is a very, very safe way of putting it. Is this poem about poetry? Is it about sex? Is it about religion? Is it about mortality? I'll need time to think about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have a great weekend, all.</content>

  <title type='text'>'Bavaria' by Mary Ruefle</title>
  <content type='html'>I want to take a short break from reading Emily Dickinson (&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/emily-dickinson-26-its-all-i-have-to.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/emily-dickinson-144-i-never-hear-word.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) to look at a short poem by Mary Ruefle. Among many other things, I've been reading this really great special feature on Ruefle's poetry in issue 4 of &lt;a href="http://www.musicandliterature.org/subscribe/" target="_blank"&gt;Music &amp;amp; Literature&lt;/a&gt;. It features eight of her poems, which I've loved, alongside essays about her and a really interesting interview with her (you can &lt;a href="http://www.musicandliterature.org/excerpts/2014/3/19/a-conversation-with-mary-ruefle" target="_blank"&gt;read a little of that interview here&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/uploads/authors/mary-ruefle/448x/mary-ruefle.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/uploads/authors/mary-ruefle/448x/mary-ruefle.jpg" height="209" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I don't want to get overexcited. In &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/blossom-by-april-bernard.html" target="_blank"&gt;a piece I wrote about April Bernard&lt;/a&gt; I gushed that she was one of the great discoveries I would look back on for a lifetime. Well... I pulled a few of her books from the library and I just wasn't into them. I still love &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/blossom-by-april-bernard.html" target="_blank"&gt;that poem, 'Blossom'&lt;/a&gt;, but the rest of her stuff just doesn't do it for me. For me to be a fan of a poet, I've got to enjoy at least half of their work. I definitely wasn't hitting that number in my reading of April Bernard. Not because she's bad, not because she does anything wrong: I just don't enjoy it. So I'll wait and see about Mary Ruefle, but right now I'm getting good signs from the little I've read.

Anyway, here's 'Bavaria', a poem freely available through the &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/mary-ruefle" target="_blank"&gt;Poetry Foundation's page for Mary Ruefle&lt;/a&gt; (the image above is from their site, as well).

&lt;div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;"&gt;The mountain skies were clear&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;"&gt;except for the umlaut of a cloud&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;"&gt;over the village.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;"&gt;The little girl wore yellow gloves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;"&gt;She looked in the peephole and saw&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;"&gt;a stack of unused marionettes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;"&gt;Yet, she wondered.&lt;/div&gt;
This poem reminds me so much of &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/an-impression-by-gu-cheng.html" target="_blank"&gt;'An Impression' by Gu Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, both in its form and its content. Both poems use children as a sort of emblem of innocence and possibility. Both poems are small, painting an enchanting picture in just a few strokes. And there's a similar sense of motion as our eye descends from the sky to the cloud to the little girl to her gloves, and from there we see through her eyes to the marionettes, and then we enter her thoughts for that last little puzzle of a line.

I love coherence. There are some people who see the world as terribly ordered and exact, and they make poetry into a wild place where things can break loose. I see the world as wild and disordered, and I want poetry that allows things to make sense. Order, progression, meaning, rhythm, music: these resonate with me.

OK, I must be going. Until tomorrow, friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a class="twitter-share-button" data-text="Reading 'Bavaria' by Mary Ruefle" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/bavaria-by-mary-ruefle.html" data-via="timothyjellison" href="https://twitter.com/share"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F10%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/bavaria-by-mary-ruefle.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" style="border: none; height: 21px; overflow: hidden;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Emily Dickinson, #144: "I never hear the word 'escape'"</title>
  <content type='html'>Today I want to look at another Dickinson poem, but first I need to do a little shameless self-promotion.&amp;nbsp; I've been serving for the last couple months as an Assistant Managing Editor at &lt;a href="http://www.asymptotejournal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;*Asymptote*&lt;/a&gt;. The first issue I've helped produce &lt;a href="http://www.asymptotejournal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;is now live&lt;/a&gt;. Please do check it out; there's a great feature of new poetry in English by authors like &lt;a href="http://www.asymptotejournal.com/article.php?cat=Special_Feature&amp;amp;id=160&amp;amp;curr_index=33&amp;amp;curPage=current" target="_blank"&gt;Mary Jo Bang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.asymptotejournal.com/article.php?cat=Special_Feature&amp;amp;id=164&amp;amp;curr_index=36&amp;amp;curPage=current" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Farrell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.asymptotejournal.com/article.php?cat=Special_Feature&amp;amp;id=166&amp;amp;curr_index=37&amp;amp;curPage=current" target="_blank"&gt;Genya Turovskaya&lt;/a&gt;. Go ahead and &lt;a href="http://www.asymptotejournal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;!

So back to Emily Dickinson. I'm reading these poems in the order they appear in a little &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Selected-Poems-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486264661" target="_blank"&gt;Dover Thrift Edition of Dickinson&lt;/a&gt;'s poems. If you're on a budget and looking to start a good collection of English and American poetry, &lt;a href="http://store.doverpublications.com/by-subject-thrift-editions-poetry.html" target="_blank"&gt;check out Dover Thrift Editions&lt;/a&gt;. OK, without further ado, here's #144. &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/emily-dickinson-26-its-all-i-have-to.html" target="_blank"&gt;Like yesterday's poem&lt;/a&gt;, it's a ballad stanza, though this time the rhymes are more interesting.
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I never hear the word “Escape”
Without a quicker blood,
A sudden expectation –
A flying attitude!

I never hear of prisons broad
By soldiers battered down,
But I tug childish at my bars
Only to fail again!&lt;/blockquote&gt;I don't want to over-read based on what little I know of Dickinson's life. There's a popular image of Dickinson as a shut-in. I don't know anything about Dickinson, really. I understand from Wikipedia (our paper of record) that her mother became ill in the 1850s, and it fell on the twenty-something Emily to stay home and take care of her. She wrote the bulk of her poems — the eight hundred poems that would not be published until after her death — from 1858 to 1863. It wasn't until 1867 that she really drew into real seclusion. (And really, don't trust these dates; there are contradictory dates even in the same Wiki article. &amp;lt;Sigh&amp;gt;) And I don't want to throw in too much historical speculation, either. Slavery is of course a hot issue at the time she is writing. And she's writing post-1848, so the spirit of revolution is in the air and in the newspapers. And she admired the writing of Ralph Waldo Emerson, for whom liberation and non-conformity were a major themes.

These facts are relevant, even though I can't use them definitively, but for now let's just look at the poetry. The thing that most stands out to me, especially after &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/emily-dickinson-26-its-all-i-have-to.html" target="_blank"&gt;yesterday's poem&lt;/a&gt;, is that the rhyme is much more slanted. First, "blood" is force to rhyme with "attitude", which is a bit of a stretch but not asking too much. In the second stanza, though, the expected rhyme actually breaks with "down" - "again".

Here's the interesting part: Dickinson *does *break the form that holds her (by breaking the rhyme scheme) even as she asserts that she has *failed* to break her childish bars. Poetry, then, is not the same as her childish bars. She can break the poetry, but that won't free her. I couldn't say for sure, but I think *poetry is her way out* (out of herself? out of her home/family? out of her town? out of her culture?). She is exploring the space between her domestic/poetic world and the larger/apoetic world, as she does in one of her most famous poems:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I never saw a moor;
I never saw the sea,
Yet know I how the heather looks
And what a billow be.

I never spoke with God,
Nor visited in heaven.
Yet certain am I of the spot
As if the checks were given. &lt;/blockquote&gt;The wider world comes to her *as language*. Language and poetry are her means of breaking free. &lt;b&gt;*Words themselves — individual utterances and markings like "Escape" — are the liberating soldiers*&lt;/b&gt;. The freedom she acquires is, I think, more existential than political or social. I'll have to investigate that more tomorrow. I've sat on this post too long.

Until tomorrow, all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/10/emily-dickinson-144-i-never-hear-word.html" data-text="Reading more Dickinson today.

  <title type='text'>Emily Dickinson, #26: 'It’s all I have to bring today"</title>
  <content type='html'>For at least the next few days I just want to read some Emily Dickinson. There's something about reading Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams and Robert Frost that feels like *coming home*. We had &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Six-American-Poets-An-Anthology/dp/0679745254" target="_blank"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; at home while I was growing up; the only poet in the collection that I never connected with was Langston Hughes. We also had &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Yorker-Book-Poems/dp/068807877X" target="_blank"&gt;this beast&lt;/a&gt; and I *really* never understood what it was about.

So, Emily Dickinson. This is poem #26. It's two ballad stanzas — alternating lines of eight and six syllables with a rhyme ending the 2nd and 4th lines of each stanza.
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;It’s all I have to bring today—
This, and my heart beside—
This, and my heart, and all the fields—
And all the meadows wide—
Be sure you count—should I forget
Some one the sum could tell—
This, and my heart, and all the Bees
Which in the Clover dwell.

*(&lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/its-all-i-have-bring-today-26" target="_blank"&gt;text copied from Poets.org&lt;/a&gt;)*&lt;/blockquote&gt;There's a lot to be said here. First of all there's that great start; it hits the ground running. "It's" has no referent. *What *is all she has to bring today? It has to be (doesn't it?) this very poem. Who is she bringing the poem to? And why? And does she bring something *every day*?

The gift keeps growing, as though it were being coyly given, or as if it the giver were only becoming aware of the gift's full extent *in the act of giving*.

The word Clover is interesting. Take out the L and you have 'Cover'; take out the C and you have 'lover'. Anything to that? Possibly, but I'm interested in just the plain sense. The Bees dwell in the clover, and they are being brought. The poet isn't taking them out of the Clover to bring them. She brings the Bees &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; their dwelling place. If that's how we read it, then we don't necessarily have to assume there's an act of violence in bringing her heart. The heart remains and dwells within the breast and yet is brought and given.

But am I going too far in my reading? Why do I think these things are being given? They are merely being brought and presented. And why? *To be counted*.

I got caught up in a scene from the New Testament.
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents.

Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on.”

— &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12:41-44" target="_blank"&gt;Mark 12: 41-44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Everything *counts*.* *If you have a talent, you have to give it, and God will remember. When Dickinson writes "Be sure you count" -- who is the "you"? The simplest answer is, of course, *you*. You, dear reader, are put into the position of God. The poet asks for your love; the poem is an offering. The field and the meadow and the bees in the clover are poetic things, the content of poetry, and with them come the poet's heart, the source of poetry, and the poem itself, the form.

Using words like "sacrifice" presumes the wrong model of the poet/worshiper's interaction with the reader/God. This isn't about sacrifice; it's about *presentation*. Things are shown, whole and alive. From Christopher Smart's 'Jubilate Agno':
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Let the Levites of the Lord take the Beavers of the brook alive into the Ark of the Testimony.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The poet brings without giving away; the poet lets things live as they are, not in some new way inimical to the nature of the things presented. So the self and the world are put on display and remain intact; this is the beauty of 'this', the poem as such. There is vulnerability, but not *too much *vulnerability. It puts you, as the reader, in an interesting position. It demands a certain maturity from you, a certain gravity. As a thing to say to God -- well, it also puts some interesting demands on God. "Respect my individuality," it says. "Remember what I've done, because I'm busy living and am liable to forget."

That forgetting is really *the most *interesting thing, isn't it? How strange it is. Why should the poet forget? But again I think of the New Testament.
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;“Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’

&lt;b&gt;“Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’&lt;/b&gt;

“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’"

&lt;a href="http://biblehub.com/niv/matthew/25.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Matthew 25:34-40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The righteous forget the good they've done. Dickinson may have been wondering, as many do, how many poems should I write? Can a writer write too much? Should I write five hundred good poems and maybe five will be great, or should I spend my life crafting fifty perfect poems and maybe six will be great? She decides on *&lt;b&gt;daily presentation&lt;/b&gt;*. She will say again and again, through poetry, to the world and for the world, *&lt;b&gt;'Here I am'&lt;/b&gt;*.

Too much to say, too much to say. I'll write on another Dickinson poem tomorrow. Much love, amigos.

  <title type='text'>'The X Man' by Kathryn Maris</title>
  <content type='html'>Today and tomorrow I'd like to share a couple poems from &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/toc/2444" target="_blank"&gt;the new issue of *Poetry*&lt;/a&gt;. Honestly, there wasn't much I was crazy about in this issue, but it's all about taking time to find the little things that stand out.

Here's &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/248792" target="_blank"&gt;'The X Man'&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/kathryn-maris" target="_blank"&gt;Kathryn Maris&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;His superpower was that his testicles manufactured sperm
with exclusively X chromosomes &amp;amp; that was ironic because
not only was he a beast to women but his 40 baby girls grew
up seeking men like the father they barely saw unless they went
to his studio to be painted which wasn’t OK with their mothers
who were not only jealous but guilty of giving birth to girls
who were products of an X-chromosome-making monster
&amp;amp; would soon suffer at the hands of other monsters with X-
type sperm thereby assuring the continuation of suffering
&amp;amp; meanwhile all the girls became writers who slouched
from sitting at desks &amp;amp; being daughters &amp;amp; lovers of beasts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Just take that first line and a half: "His superpower was that his testicles manufactured sperm / with exclusively X chromosomes". Quite an intro! There's a danger with a poem that opens with a bang that the whole thing will diffuse afterward, but Maris lets it build and unfold in stages, repeating the key phrases and adding new details a little at a time.

What to do with those 40 baby girls who all became writers. Perhaps Maris is talking about one person's suffering but diluting it by treating it as a larger phenomenon. (Like in one of Thomas Mann's novels there's a main character who is dying of typhoid, and rather than go into great detail about his sickness Mann talks about the sickness generally, like he was writing a textbook: it's a way of indicating that the subject was too painful even for the narrator, a way of talking *around *what happened because that's all one can handle.) Perhaps it's a way of talking about writers in general, about their self-destructive tendencies. It's like an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology" target="_blank"&gt;etiological myth&lt;/a&gt;: here's the story of why the daughters of shitty artist guys tragically tend to become artists who love shitty artist guys, "thereby assuring the continuation of suffering."

Oy; that's all I've got for today. Gotta get some work done because, you know, that's what I do. Until tomorrow, y'all.

  <title type='text'>'Anecdote for Fathers' by William Wordsworth</title>
  <content type='html'>Last night I wrote a long, cynical tirade against National Poetry Day, but then decided not to post it. I was about to start summing it up for you just now; my fingers hovered over the keyboard, ready to rehash all that savagery. But who needs that, right?

Writing about poetry just isn't making me happy like it should. I've demanded too much of myself lately and I haven't given myself anything in return, or I haven't allowed myself to take any of the things that are being offered in return. I just read this checklist of &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5884439/burnout-is-real-how-to-identify-the-problem-and-how-to-fix-it" target="_blank"&gt;signs you're burning out from overwork&lt;/a&gt; and it was like "Check... check... check...."

I put a lot of pressure on myself and refuse to be satisfied with anything I do. I feel, sometimes, that the only satisfaction I get as a writer (as you're about to see in the poem below) is the partial relief that comes from just having said *anything*. I put myself into high pressure situations so that I can *force myself *to say *something*. Is that bad, or is that how it's supposed to work? I really don't know.

Here's a poem about pressure and the imagination. Like everything Wordsworth wrote, it's more complex than it looks at first. Anyway, here's 'Anecdote for Fathers':
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I have a boy of five years old;
His face is fair and fresh to see;
His limbs are cast in beauty's mould,
And dearly he loves me.

One morn we strolled on our dry walk,
Our quiet home all full in view,
And held such intermitted talk
As we are wont to do.

My thoughts on former pleasures ran;
I thought of Kilve's delightful shore,
Our pleasant home when spring began,
A long, long year before.

A day it was when I could bear
Some fond regrets to entertain;
With so much happiness to spare,
I could not feel a pain.

The green earth echoed to the feet
Of lambs that bounded through the glade,
From shade to sunshine, and as fleet
From sunshine back to shade.

Birds warbled round me -- and each trace
of inward sadness had its charm;
Kilve, thought I, was a favored place,
And so is Liswyn farm.

My boy beside me tripped, so slim
And graceful in his rustic dress!
And, as we talked, I questioned him,
In very idleness.

"Now tell me, had you rather be,"
I said, and took him by the arm,
"On Kilve's smooth shore, by the green sea,
Or here at Liswyn farm?"

In careless mood he looked at me,
While still I held him by the arm,
And said, "At Kilve I'd rather be
Than here at Liswyn farm."

"Now, little Edward, say why so:
My little Edward, tell me why." --
"I cannot tell, I do not know." --
"Why, this is strange," said I;

"For, here are woods, hills smooth and warm:
There surely must some reason be
Why you would change sweet Liswyn farm
For Kilve by the green sea."

At this, my boy hung down his head,
He blushed with shame, nor made reply;
And three times to the child I said,
"Why, Edward, tell me why?"

His head he raised -- there was in sight,
It caught his eye, he saw it plain --
Upon the house-top, glittering bright,
A broad and gilded vane.

Then did the boy his tongue unlock,
And eased his mind with this reply:
"At Kilve there was no weather-cock;
And that's the reason why."

O dearest, dearest boy! my heart
For better lore would seldom yearn,
Could I but teach the hundredth part
Of what from thee I learn.&lt;/blockquote&gt;We're all the little boy, Edward. We try to patch together a sense of the world using what little we can remember or perceive, because someone (in this case, our father) is calling us to account. "Why, Edward, tell me why?" His father is forcing him to put everything in terms of words, so Edward looks around and scrapes together an explanation from the first thing he sees. That explanation "eased his mind." We are terribly contingent creatures.

And yet — the substance of art is the memory and perception of just such contingencies. Giving ourselves up to these contingencies, participating fully in them, *actually does make us happy*. This afternoon I went out for a walk through Boston Common and the Public Garden during my lunch break. One of the trees in the park had a placard nailed into it; I had never noticed that some of&amp;nbsp; the trees were labelled. The placard told me that it was a Belgian elm. I noticed the color and texture of the bark, the shape of its leaves. I looked up Belgian elms on my phone to see what I could learn about them, and while I was at it I looked up a couple other trees I saw nearby. Then, as I continued to walk, I noticed details as I could not have noticed before. This path was shaded by a canopy of Belgian elms. On that next turn there was a yellow oak leaf fallen on the path, the first of many. *I noticed more of the world through language, &lt;b&gt;and it made me glad&lt;/b&gt;*.

So perhaps Wordsworth's poem isn't nearly as sneering as I've always interpreted it to be. Perhaps this learning how to turn things into words is a joy we have to be trained to experience, like the joy of playing a musical instrument or speaking a second language. By expanding our vocabulary, by strengthening our connection to the world through words, we become more in control of ourselves and our situation. That's the worst part of being overworked: everything feels out of control. When I'm really stressed out, all I can think of is *freedom from*. Freedom from work, freedom from responsibilities, freedom from certain people and places. But what I really need to focus on is *the freedom to*.&amp;nbsp; The freedom to read and write and appreciate nature and the city and the people I love, and not just passively but actively putting my full self into those acts. Maybe *in that *there is satisfaction.

Until next week, all.</content>

Are you aware that &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/toc/2444" target="_blank"&gt;the October issue of *Poetry* is currently available for free online&lt;/a&gt;? Are you aware that it is a special issue featuring poetry from the UK? Are you aware that this is so fucking awesome that it's caused me to break my "no cursing" rule?

Are you aware that this issue of&lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/toc/2444" target="_blank"&gt;* Poetry*&lt;/a&gt; contains &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/toc/2444" target="_blank"&gt;over three dozen poems&lt;/a&gt;? Are you aware that it's kind of strange to count in dozens unless you work at Dunkin Donuts or have six fingers on each hand? Are you aware that this issue of &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/toc/2444" target="_blank"&gt;*Poetry*&lt;/a&gt; contains &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/248812" target="_blank"&gt;an essay&lt;/a&gt; by the inimitable &lt;a href="http://toddswift.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Todd Swift&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.eyewearpublishing.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Eyewear Publishing&lt;/a&gt;? Are you aware that every minute you spend here and not reading this issue of &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/toc/2444" target="_blank"&gt;*Poetry*&lt;/a&gt; is a wasted minute?

Be aware, friend.

Much love,

Tim

  <title type='text'>Robert Pinsky's Voice</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393348970/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0393348970&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=EIWCMSM2UGBXG5PA" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=0393348970&amp;amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20" height="320" width="212" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This past Thursday I attended &lt;a href="http://dailyfreepress.com/2014/09/25/pinsky/" target="_blank"&gt;a poetry reading&lt;/a&gt; to commemorate the anniversary of Robert Pinsky's *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Singing-School-Learning-Studying-Masters/dp/0393348970/" target="_blank"&gt;Singing School&lt;/a&gt;. *Pinsky was there, of course, along with Dan Chiasson, Karl Kirchwey, Luisa Caycedo-Kimura, and Ha Jin. Each poet read a poem or two out of *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Singing-School-Learning-Studying-Masters/dp/0393348970/" target="_blank"&gt;Singing School&lt;/a&gt;*, an anthology that includes the poems Pinsky has considered essential to his education as a writer and reader of poetry. There's a lot of 16th century and 17th century English lyric, which I love, especially Wyatt and Raleigh and Herrick and Lovelace. And there's a lot of 20th century poetry, too, including Frank O'Hara, Elizabeth Bishop, and May Swenson.&amp;nbsp;And there's a lot of everything in between. It's a great little book — *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Singing-School-Learning-Studying-Masters/dp/0393348970/" target="_blank"&gt;Singing School&lt;/a&gt;*, check it out.
*
*Reading through the book over the last couple days I've been amazed by how similar my own taste is to Pinsky's. I kept saying to myself, "I wish this book had poem X," and then I'd turn the page and there it would be. We have a taste for musicality. Poems that aren't musical in some way just can't hold my attention. Not that they have to be bouncing up and down with ABAB rhymes, but I like there to be some push forward, a rhythm that pulls you into a groove, a distinct mood that tells you whether you should be yelling or whispering or reading in an English or an American accent. If a poem isn't going to have that, I want it to be very short, like Ezra Pound's &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/104/106.html" target="_blank"&gt;"In a Station of the Metro"&lt;/a&gt; .

With that taste for music comes a sort of theatricality. Robert Pinsky, if you haven't seen him before, is a very theatrical reader. He has a powerful voice that he clearly enjoys, like a musician enjoys his instrument. I've probably shared this before, but here's Pinsky on the Colbert Report.

You might think that's a bit hammy; I think I would have thought so only a few years ago. But now I think that's in keeping with things I've already said here on the blog. Reading poetry is about *you*. You're getting to know poetry better, yes, and yes it makes you more sensitive to other people and points of view, but the main point of reading poetry (or contemplating *anything*, really) is that it helps you come to terms with yourself. Part of coming to terms with yourself is learning to enjoy yourself: your mind, your body, your voice. So reading poems — slowly, aloud, with full commitment to the thought and the feeling — means you get to be a bit of a philosopher, a dancer, an actor. You get to do more and be more. Pick up *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Singing-School-Learning-Studying-Masters/dp/0393348970/" target="_blank"&gt;Singing School&lt;/a&gt; *— it's a good place to start.

A quick note of gratitude: Ha Jin read one of my favorite poems by Yeats — &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/172057" target="_blank"&gt;"Adam's Curse"&lt;/a&gt; — and really made me see it in a new way. I especially love that he pointed out this little fact: the protagonist is talking about how difficult it is to write a poem and then remarks:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;"&gt;Yet if it does not seem a moment’s thought,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;"&gt;Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Now "stitching and unstitching" is of course a reference to sewing, which is an interesting analogy to writing poetry, but it also subtly alludes to the Ancient Greek word *stichos,* meaning a line of verse. (&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/ws-merwins-moon-before-morning-book_24.html" target="_blank"&gt;I talked a little about the *stichos *in this post.&lt;/a&gt;) But yeah — multilingual puns! I do eat that stuff up.

Until tomorrow, all.

  <title type='text'>W.S. Merwin's The Moon Before Morning (Book Review Week, 4/4)</title>
  <content type='html'>We're going to end with four posts about W.S. Merwin's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moon-Before-Morning-W-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;*The Moon Before Midnight*&lt;/a&gt; rather than five. Why? Really it's this: yesterday I found a little time to slow down and relax, and I took it.

I've been too stressed out lately. I'm basically working my day job, a medium-sized job on the side, a smaller job on the side, and writing this blog. And now I've been asked to do another blog for a much more demanding audience. It's crazy. It's fun, and fulfilling, and makes me more hopeful for my future than I've been in quite a while, but it's crazy.&amp;nbsp;

But enough about me. Let's get back to Merwin. I want to talk briefly about form. &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/ws-merwins-moon-before-morning-book_24.html" target="_blank"&gt;Looking at the poem 'Homecoming' on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, I stressed the poem's amorphous quality, and how we seemed to be allowed to read both backward and forward in a way that allowed us to experience the subjective aspects of time even while feeling the irresistible forward motion of decay/desire. OK, sure: amorphous-ness. But there was some form to it, wasn't there? Divide it into four-line groups. Look how they begin: "Once ... I looked ... and saw ... long curving wings hardly moving ... but home now arriving." The poem can be broken into logical units; it's important that it isn't, but it's also important that it can be.

So what other forms does Merwin use in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moon-Before-Morning-W-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;*The Moon Before Morning*&lt;/a&gt;, and how does he use those forms, and how does he resist other forms?

The second poem is a lovely sort of haiku, though it doesn't follow the normal metrical rules of haiku. I'll go ahead and share that one since it's so — wow.
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Rain through the morning
and in the long pool a toad singing
happiness old as water

— "By the Front Door", W.S. Merwin, *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moon-Before-Morning-W-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;The Moon Before Morning&lt;/a&gt;*, Copper Canyon Press, ©2014, p.6  &lt;/blockquote&gt;Just really quickly: whenever you notice somebody singing or playing music in a poem, especially if it's toward the beginning of a long poem or the beginning of a collection, the poet is probably talking about her- or himself as a poet. It's a very *meta *gesture. Even the title feels meta — how can "By the Front Door" not be a sly reference to the beginning of the book, just as "Homecoming" was? It's a common gesture. Virgil did it. Dante did it. &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/dream-song-1-by-john-berryman.html" target="_blank"&gt;John Berryman did it&lt;/a&gt;. A million poets have done it. Merwin's doing it here. Merwin is the toad; the toad is Merwin. He welcomes the comparison. The littleness of the poet in the poem is matched by the unassuming littleness of the poem itself. And isn't the toad teaching us, in this little poem where we have to add such heavy pauses at the end of each line, exactly how we ought to be reading these poems, and this book as a whole?

For me, the shorter poems are the best ones in this book. When Merwin uses longer forms he becomes more generic, more common. But as a whole, the book is a strong one. It's one of the rare books that I'll actually go out and buy a copy of, because I would be glad and proud to have it on my shelf.

I have to start wrapping this up. Isn't this ridiculous? I've written so many words about *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moon-Before-Morning-W-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;The Moon Before Morning&lt;/a&gt;* now and yet I still feel like I haven't said anything at all. I've learned from the process — some of the things I've written here so matter-of-factly I only *learned through the act of writing *them. Writing here on this blog is a very associative process for me; it's so easygoing that I feel guilty about it sometimes. But whatever. I'm not an academic. This isn't for a literary journal. This is a fun place. A relaxed place. It's good I took that day off, because I needed a little down-time to remember that. I look forward to coming back next week.
&lt;br/&gt;Have a good weekend, all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://tinyurl.com/msoka99" data-text="One last look at W.S.

  <title type='text'>W.S. Merwin's The Moon Before Morning (Book Review Week, 3/4)</title>
  <content type='html'>*Stichic integrity*. I learned this term from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brian-Turner/e/B001K7X8VU" target="_blank"&gt;Brian Turner, author of two excellent poetry collections and a new memoir&lt;/a&gt;. If you Google *stichic integrity *you'll find &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2006/02/journal-day-two-23/" target="_blank"&gt;this article by Turner&lt;/a&gt;, in which he describes how, when writing and editing his own poetry, "each line [*needs*] to be considered in isolation for its own strengths and weaknesses." Each line needs to stand on its own two feet.

(Fun fact: *stichos* — "stich" pronounced like "stick", "os" as in "cost" —,* *is Ancient Greek for "line" or "verse.")

But this doesn't mean that a line&amp;nbsp; has to be a single sentence or idea. This confused me for a long time. A line's strength can come from playful ambiguity. Here's Turner from that same &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2006/02/journal-day-two-23/" target="_blank"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I like to call some lines ‘wrap-around’ lines. It’s when two phrases  cohabitate on the same line. For example: “on a sidewalk, a blistered  hand’s gold ring.” That line, for me, has stichic integrity because the  two parts play off of each other. The *blistered hand’s gold ring* can be read as existing *on the sidewalk*. In the very next line after that (*still shining, while a medic, Doc Lopez*) Doc Lopez can be read to be still *shining*. Basically, there is an interplay of meaning, an exchange of relationships, built into the positioning of phrases themselves. &lt;/blockquote&gt;By placing the tail of one phrase onto the same line as the head of another phrase, Turner allows their meanings to intermingle. This preserves the logical sense (we can follow natural English sentences rather than puzzle over fragments) while allowing room for the reader's imagination to play. It slows you down and rewards imaginative reading.

W.S. Merwin accomplishes something similar throughout *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moon-Before-Morning-W-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;The Moon Before Morning&lt;/a&gt;* by giving you just the lines with no guides or cues for how he wants you to read them. There's no punctuation to guide your breath; often there are no stanza breaks to show you where one section ends and another begins. It's just the lines on the page and you. I'll give you a brief example from the first poem in the collection, "Homecoming":
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Once only when the summer
was nearly over and my own
hair had been white as the day's clouds&lt;/blockquote&gt;Let's stop right there. The first line is a little bumpy "Once only when": we might reasonably expect a small pause after "only". Then take the two first two lines together: "Once only when the summer / was nearly over and my own." This could work; that "the summer was... my own" is a little heavy-handedly poetic, but it could work. He could begin the story now. But the "my own" carries over to "hair" and we see that the thought spills over the line. We thought it was over, but it kept going. Does that mean the "summer was ... my own" reading is invalid now? *&lt;b&gt;Logically, yes; Imaginatively, no&lt;/b&gt;*. Now it's richer, more ambiguous, more meaningful thanks to its arbitrary positioning between "summer" and "hair". Let's try again:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Once only when the summer
was nearly over and my own
hair had been white as the day's clouds
for more years than I was counting
I looked across the garden at evening&lt;/blockquote&gt;Just look at that fourth line and how well it fits with both the line-and-a-half that precede it ("my own hair had been white as the day's clouds // for more years than I was counting") and the line that follows it ("for more years than I was counting // I looked across the garden at evening"). Time flows in many directions; the arrangement of lines controls it, but only just.

Notice also that a new section has begun with "I looked across the garden." There's a heavy pause after "counting," the first really heavy pause of the poem. What a perfect word to pause at, especially in the first poem of the collection when we're just learning how the poet counts his lines! The first four lines have been establishing setting and character, and with the fifth line we begin the action. Here's the rest of the poem:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Once only when the summer
was nearly over and my own
hair had been white as the day's clouds
for more years than I was counting
I looked across the garden at evening
Paula was still weeding around
flowers that open after dark
and I looked up at the clear sky
and saw the new moon and at that
moment from behind me a band
of dark birds and then another
after it flying in silence
long curving wings hardly moving
the plovers just in from the sea
and the flight clear from Alaska
half their weight gone to get them home
but home now arriving without
a sound as it rose to meet them

"Homecoming", W.S. Merwin, *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moon-Before-Morning-W-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;The Moon Before Morning&lt;/a&gt;*, Copper Canyon Press, ©2014, p.5  &lt;/blockquote&gt;You sense the pauses now? The way each line both does and doesn't flow into the one after it? Think about it in terms of stichic integrity. You become *responsible *for the poem, and this responsibility slows you down and makes you experience the peaceful scene the poetic speaker himself is witnessing. I love the heavy pause after "silence" in the twelfth line, and the powerful slowness of the line that follows: "long curving wings hardly moving". And then "moving" takes or seems to take "the plovers" as its direct object, so we know we can't stop. "Hardly moving", yes, but moving all the same. The thought settles into a shape (a line) and then — by the pressure of its desire to keep going — breaks itself. Masterful. Isn't that the word?

Until tomorrow, all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/ws-merwins-moon-before-morning-book_24.html" data-text="Merwin, stichic integrity, and learning how to pause" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F09%2Fws-merwins-moon-before-morning-book_24.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>W.S. Merwin's The Moon Before Morning (Book Review Week, 2/4)</title>
  <content type='html'>I have the craziest damn day ahead of me, so unfortunately I just don't have time to do any writing. Here's some good stuff to read to familiarize yourself with W.S. Merwin's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Moon-Before-Morning-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;*The Moon Before Morning*&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/22/moon-before-morning-ws-merwin-beautiful" target="_blank"&gt;Fiona Sampson's excellent review at *The Guardian*.&lt;/a&gt; If you only read one of these articles, make it this one.

&lt;a href="http://www.kansas.com/entertainment/books/article2101981.html" target="_blank"&gt;Arlice Davenport's paean to Merwin in the Wichita Eagle&lt;/a&gt;. I find terms like 'greatest living poet' unhelpful; people who use the term are leaning toward the idea of priesthood. (Last line: "May he keep blessing us with his superlative gift for many more years to come.") But, still, Davenport seems to have read the book well and gotten some of the main points.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://therumpus.net/2014/09/the-moon-before-morning-by-w-s-merwin/" target="_blank"&gt;Camden Avery's excessively lyrical review on The Rumpus&lt;/a&gt;. Writing about poetry doesn't require writing poetic prose.

&lt;a href="http://poetsatwork.org/poetry-book-reviews/w-s-merwins-the-moon-before-morning/" target="_blank"&gt;Timothy Liu's snarky review on Poets At Work&lt;/a&gt;. I'm all for negative reviews, but this one is regrettably mean-spirited, and Liu gives away at several points that he hasn't been reading carefully. &amp;lt;Sigh&amp;gt;

Happy reading, happy hunting, happy birthday, etc. etc. etc. Until tomorrow, all.

  <title type='text'>W.S. Merwin's The Moon Before Morning (Book Review Week, 1/4)</title>
  <content type='html'>
Rather than complain that Twitter posts and many blogs are too cursory and too canonical in their coverage of poetry, I'm going to counteract the offending trendings and write a slower, more concentrated review about a new book of poetry: W.S. Merwin's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Moon-Before-Morning-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;*The Moon Before Morning*&lt;/a&gt;. Over the course of this week I want to focus on a few key aspects of Merwin's newest book, including his renunciation of punctuation, the arrangement of the poems within the book, and the poetic forms he chooses. (Edit: here are links to parts &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/ws-merwins-moon-before-morning-book_23.html" target="_blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/ws-merwins-moon-before-morning-book_24.html" target="_blank"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/ws-merwins-moon-before-morning-book_26.html" target="_blank"&gt;four&lt;/a&gt;.)

But today I just want to gather some information about Merwin into one place. You might have noticed that many of my readings lean toward the New Critical school of thinking: I read the poem as a self-contained unit, rarely going into a poem's or poet's historical context in a way that might inform my reading of a text. But that, I'm afraid, is more out of laziness than ideology. I don't believe in the great Tradition, but at times I read like someone who does. Let's counteract that.

*&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Moon-Before-Morning-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;The Moon Before Morning&lt;/a&gt; *is Merwin's fourteenth book with &lt;a href="https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/pages/browse/author.asp?ag={5D7D8EE9-7AC6-473F-91DA-F8CCDE1A1B98}" target="_blank"&gt;Copper Canyon Press&lt;/a&gt;; he's been publishing with them for just over twenty years now, though much more prolifically in the last decade. I like Copper Canyon's two paragraph bio, so here it is:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;W.S. &lt;span data-scayt_word="Merwin" data-scaytid="1"&gt;Merwin&lt;/span&gt; was  born in New York City in 1927 and was United States Poet Laureate in  2010. He graduated from Princeton University in 1948, where he studied  with John &lt;span data-scayt_word="Berryman" data-scaytid="2"&gt;Berryman&lt;/span&gt; and R.P. &lt;span data-scayt_word="Blackmur" data-scaytid="3"&gt;Blackmur&lt;/span&gt;. From 1949 to 1951 he worked as a tutor in France, &lt;span data-scayt_word="Mallorca" data-scaytid="4"&gt;Mallorca&lt;/span&gt;,  and Portugal; for several years afterward he made the greater part of  his living by translating from French, Spanish, Latin, and Portuguese.  His first book of poetry, *A Mask for Janus* (1952) was selected by W.H. &lt;span data-scayt_word="Auden" data-scaytid="7"&gt;Auden&lt;/span&gt; for the Yale Younger Poets Prize.

Since then, &lt;span data-scayt_word="Merwin" data-scaytid="5"&gt;Merwin&lt;/span&gt; has authored dozens of books of poetry and prose. His work embodies a  bold commitment to experimentation and transformation rooted in the  moral necessity of bearing witness, and is influenced by his profoundly  environmentalist, pacifist, and anti–imperialist beliefs.&amp;nbsp;He has  won&amp;nbsp;many awards, as well as fellowships from the Rockefeller and the  Guggenheim Foundations and the National Endowment for the Arts. W.S. &lt;span data-scayt_word="Merwin" data-scaytid="6"&gt;Merwin&lt;/span&gt; has lived in Hawaii since 1976.

— taken whole-cloth from &lt;a href="https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/pages/browse/author.asp?ag=%7B5D7D8EE9-7AC6-473F-91DA-F8CCDE1A1B98%7D" target="_blank"&gt;Copper Canyon's website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;That last, tiny sentence is terribly important. Merwin and his poetry are inextricably bound to Hawaii. He isn't just a poet who writes about the environment; he's a committed environmentalist who practices what he preaches on his three acre palm plantation on Maui. From the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704604704576220602720997650" target="_blank"&gt;Wall Street Journal's profile&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Mr. Merwin's path to his palm forest was an indirect one. The son of a  Presbyterian minister, he was born in New York, lived in France and then  came to Hawaii in the 1970s to study Zen Buddhism. Not long after  arriving, he heard of a small piece of land near the coast with a small  cabin, the place where three native Hawaiian activists had hidden after  defying the U.S. Navy and occupying the bombed island of Kaho`olawe.
...
Using his small inheritance, he spent $60,000 or so for just over three  acres in 1977. With little money left, he drew plans for the house, and  recruited friends and local craftsmen to help him build it.
...
&lt;div style="font-size: 15px;"&gt;At first, Mr. Merwin said, he had somewhat  "naively" hoped to restore a rain forest with native plants. But the  soil was so leached and the conditions so dry and wind-swept that he  found the only ones that thrived were Hawaiian Pritchardias, a type of  palm. He estimates he now has more than 850 different species of palms  on the property, including a few he's saved from extinction, such as  Hyophorbe indica from Reunion Island.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-size: 15px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-size: 15px;"&gt;In  2010, shortly before Mr. Merwin agreed to become the poet laureate, the  couple created the Merwin Conservancy, preserving the home and the palm  forest and receiving nonprofit status as a retreat for writers and  botanists. "William has created one of the greatest palm collections in  the world," said Charles R. "Chipper" Wichman, director of the National  Tropical Botanical Gardens. "It is amazing."

— Julia Flynn Siler, the Wall Street Journal, March 25, 2011&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Merwin's piece of Hawaii and its progression over the decades is the subject of most of* &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Moon-Before-Morning-Merwin/dp/1556594534" target="_blank"&gt;The Moon Before Morning&lt;/a&gt;*. There is a calm and a magic to the poems that makes you understand* *why Merwin fell in love with the place. Nothing is more important than the place, including time. This loyalty to place enforces a powerful simplicity and economy. Like Ezra Pound, Merwin is a man who *knows* poetry and language, yet we see hardly any of it here. He refuses to wear his learning on his sleeve. &lt;b&gt;*Merwin's withdrawal from the West and the East to an island between is perfectly emblematic of his poetry*&lt;/b&gt;. It is a withdrawal into Nature, into the self, into the quiet things that persist when no one else is watching or listening, into things that are always true. I'm a lifelong reader of Henry David Thoreau's *Walden*; is it any wonder this collection appeals to me?

More tomorrow.&amp;nbsp;

  <title type='text'>Writing vs. Writing Well</title>
  <content type='html'>Between the beautiful sunlit hours wasted staring at thousands of pages of HTML and the rare opportunities for rest each night that I've traded in for Google chat meetings with colleagues across the globe, I got some good news.

Unfortunately I can't share the full details yet. There's a contract to be signed, and I want it to be good and binding before I say word one. I respect contracts with an intensity normally reserved for cartoon devils.

What I can tell you is that this coming change will give my writing a significantly larger reach. It's not like writing for one of the major newspapers, but it's big. It's the first big step for me after some hard falls from high places, falls that I thought had knocked the wind completely out of me.

To be honest, the prospect of writing more regularly and for a larger audience makes me nervous. On this blog I do minimal editing, and I take comfort in my freedom to not make a secret of this stream-of-consciousness approach. But ultimately I'm unhappy with most of my pieces here. Many of them I wouldn't dare put into my professional portfolio. (Note to self: start putting together a professional portfolio.)

But even when I do put some polish on my writing, I'm often dissatisfied with those pieces a few days after publication. Everything comes out too grand, too oratorical, too much like a sermon. In most of my writing there's a touch of the nineteenth century writers who first inspired me — Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman — which is fine on occasion but not in a regular column potentially read by hundreds, maybe thousands.

In this new phase of my career, I need to write more deliberately, carefully weighing each sentence for tone and rhythm and register. I want to more consciously imitate writers with mature critical voices. James Wood comes to mind. John Jeremiah Sullivan, too. Helen Vendler. John Updike. Michael Chabon. Jonathan Franzen. If I don't assure myself that I've done everything I possibly could to make the writing just how I wanted it to be, I will lose my nerve. If I'm ever going to become the writer I've always wanted to be — the person I've always wanted to be — I have to do it now.

Now I can't tell if I'm nervous or excited. Until next week, all. </content>

  <title type='text'>'The Fall of Rome' by W.H. Auden</title>
  <content type='html'>Yesterday, after burritos, my wife and I went to the library. She hunted for history books while I scoured the American poetry section. I checked out several collections of John Ashbery, John Berryman, and Robert Lowell, and critical works on all three. We carted everything back to our apartment and I started to read, which led to an important re-revelation.

I just don't *get *a lot of American poetry.

I think that, with rare and important exceptions, Dickinson and Whitman are the last American poets I feel any kind of significant connection with. Eliot was very important to me when I was younger, but I think now that that had a lot to do with his adopted Britishness.

From January to May of this year, my wife and I lived in England. I took time to read British poetry, and confirmed for myself that I really do love their style — musical, rhetorical, occasional.

But I felt conflicted, as an American abroad. Everywhere I went my speaking voice felt conspicuous, embarrassing even. I had to second guess my words at every turn. It made me want to be back home, and it made me want to learn how to speak and write more like an American.

But here, too, I feel conflicted, because I don't particularly *like *the method or subject matter of many American poets. Or I might even say, *most *American poets.So finding my place as a reader and a writer is a complex negotiation of native and foreign voices. It's a struggle to be myself and to be my ideal, to be American and to be British (understanding that 'British' may be a much more complicated term *very *soon).

&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/AudenVanVechten1939.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/AudenVanVechten1939.jpg" height="320" width="187" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So here's a poem I love by one of my key British influences, W.H. Auden. Auden is one of those poets that I can go back and read again and again. Not all of the poems are beloved poems, of course, but the ones that are just *are *poetry for me. I won't go on. Here's 'The Fall of Rome':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The piers are pummelled by the waves;
In a lonely field the rain
Lashes an abandoned train;
Outlaws fill the mountain caves.

Fantastic grow the evening gowns;
Agents of the Fisc pursue
Absconding tax-defaulters through
The sewers of provincial towns.

Private rites of magic send
The temple prostitutes to sleep;
All the literati keep
An imaginary friend.

Cerebrotonic Cato may
Extol the Ancient Disciplines,
But the muscle-bound Marines
Mutiny for food and pay.

Caesar’s double-bed is warm
As an unimportant clerk
Writes *I DO NOT LIKE MY WORK*
On a pink official form.

Unendowed with wealth or pity,
Little birds with scarlet legs,
Sitting on their speckled eggs,
Eye each flu-infected city.

Altogether elsewhere, vast
Herds of reindeer move across
Miles and miles of golden moss,
Silently and very fast.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I love this poem's combination of tones and registers. There's a sense that the past and present and future are blended. Ancient Rome exists alongside contemporary England and the U.S. Humor is juxtaposed with a bleak realism. In just twenty-eight rhymed lines, Auden captures so much of contemporary life and addresses so many important concepts: government, bureaucracy, militarism, conservatism, philistinism, etc.

Those last eight lines are so interesting. You could lift them and I think the poem would work as well as a 'fall of Rome' poem. They add something, though: a sense of menace. The reindeer, to me, communicate the coming of the barbarians. They stand in for the vast sea of humanity, the mob as herd, pure flesh. On the right scale, man is just one microbe like any of the others. But they are also the earth, Nature with a capital N, the parts of the world that won't relent to civilization, no matter how tirelessly and disastrously man (Rome) tries. This, from the right point of view, is a good thing. Though from the Roman's point of view, I'm afraid it's quite bad.

That will do it for me today. Until tomorrow, friends.

  <title type='text'>Recalculating: further thoughts on a poem by Gary Fincke</title>
  <content type='html'>I've been thinking more about &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/calculations-love-poem-by-gary-fincke.html" target="_blank"&gt;my post yesterday&lt;/a&gt; regarding Gary Fincke's 'Calculations: A Love Poem'. I hate that uneasy feeling after posting something. It's like having a pebble in your shoe, only it's an idea pebble in some kind of mental shoe, whatever that might mean.

There are two follow-up points I want to make, and then I'll call it a day.

1) I was pretty positive about the poem yesterday. I mean, I was fairly glowing about the qualities of the poem that I enjoyed.

That was misleading.

Even though I think the poem *accomplished *something interesting, that doesn't mean I'm 100% on board with the poem as a whole. I don't think it's aesthetically as-good-as-it-gets.

Normally I don't engage in negative criticism, but in this case I think it's fair as long as I point out that I'm not trying to change Fincke's poem or Fincke as a poet or come down on his work in any kind of universalizing "This is Bad!" kind of way. I'm not trying to convince you that you shouldn't read Fincke. *&lt;b&gt;I'm just trying to understand my own preferences and prejudices as a reader and a writer&lt;/b&gt;*. With that caveat in mind I think it's fair to approach the poem *as my own *and ask, *What do I want to change? What would I have done differently?*

It's quite prosy, which I'm not wild about. I feel like the structure is arbitrary; the form doesn't comment on the content and vice versa. I'm a bit of an Aristotelian. I always end up thinking in terms of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylomorphism" target="_blank"&gt;hylomorphism&lt;/a&gt; — in other words, I see *essence *as a marriage of *form *and *matter*. As Wordsworth might put it, poetry "takes its origin from emotion *[i.e. matter]* recollected in tranquility *[i.e. form]*." So I'm kind of a formalist, not because I'm conservative but because I think shapes and patterns and sing-song qualities are just plain fun. It's all about pleasure. I'm a formal hedonist.

It also feels — I don't know how to say this — *minor*. Like, I understand that it's a love poem because he says so, but it doesn't feel like there's an occasion for the poem. Why did it come to be? It feels invented, contrived, divorced from life. Or rather, divorced from the life of anybody who isn't already themselves a poet. You know what I mean? If poetry's going to be more than cryptic signs that poets read to one another, poems have to have a broader appeal. They have to come from and go toward *life*.

Note: I hate the word *life*. Especially if it's capitalized: *Life*. But like most dreadful, big words, it always seems to come up.

2) OK, now the second point. I talked about God and divine love and the Biblical interpretation of numbers, and it came off as, well, *very *Christian.
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;span class="st"&gt;God's love is a form of counting. He knows the number  of hairs on your head. He keeps careful track of the generations. We  tend to see numbers as scientific, cold, abstract, but in the language  of the Bible numbers often hold an organic, human significance. They are  a sign of connectedness rather than difference and distance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;You could have found those sentences on a Christian blog, for sure. That's not quite what I'm up to here on this blog. Don't get me wrong, even though my relationship status with the divine has been set to "It's Complicated" for a quite while, I consider myself a spiritual person. I went to a pretty liberal Catholic school where they taught us to respect all belief systems, even atheism.

Don't you kind of have to be spiritual, in a sense, in order to be a maker and appreciator of art? Don't you have to believe in some sort of transcendence and magic to want to make this stuff? To believe in the value of this stuff?

I suppose I took the Christian / Biblical route because it felt relevant to the poem. He talks about several parables, clearly with Christ's parables in mind. So I went there. But not quite obliquely or considerately enough for my own tastes. I'll have to be more careful about that next time.

So it goes, friends. Another day of writing. I'm hungry as hell. My wife and I are going to enjoy some delicious burritos and there's nothing you can do about it. Go read a poem. If you find a good one, tell me about it. I'll read a new poem and tell you all about it tomorrow. Until tomorrow, then.</content>

  <title type='text'>'Calculations: A Love Poem' by Gary Fincke</title>
  <content type='html'>Today has been marked by some very good news. I don't think I can reveal it until I've signed a contract (!), but it's going to be another big, positive change in a year that's already been full of big, positive changes.

&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lemmerQ8NeU/VBiHqzOcaRI/AAAAAAAAAhw/VBWUWcTPnzY/s1600/10600454_10100423459226421_51499095365423344_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lemmerQ8NeU/VBiHqzOcaRI/AAAAAAAAAhw/VBWUWcTPnzY/s320/10600454_10100423459226421_51499095365423344_n.jpg" height="400" width="270" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But when it rains it pours, so here's some fun news I *can* share. Today I received in the mail a print copy of &lt;a href="http://www.strangeletjournal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;the first issue of *Strangelet*&lt;/a&gt;, a journal of science fiction and fantasy that I helped edit. It's a beautiful journal, really well produced. And (height of excitement here) I'm listed on the masthead. This is the first time I've been listed on a print masthead, and I couldn't be happier about it.

I'm also now on the masthead of &lt;a href="http://www.asymptotejournal.com/about.php" target="_blank"&gt;*Asymptote*&lt;/a&gt;, as well, which is pretty marvelous. I continue to be amazed by how wildly accomplished and hard-working everyone at *Asymptote *is. It's really inspiring.

I didn't post anything yesterday. Oy. I sat down in the evening to write and literally started falling asleep as I wrote. It was sad. These things happen, though. I know that when I was younger I would freak out if I missed something I had committed to. I would doubt my motives, doubt my ability, doubt myself. I would commit to studying Latin every day for an hour, for example, and then one day I wouldn't do it for whatever reason, and that was the beginning of the end. I would just fall apart. But now I know that *you have to assume you will fail*, and you have to prepare yourself for the day when you need to pick yourself up off the ground and dust yourself off. It's really easy to stay down; once you're down there, failure is strangely attractive. You resent failure and half-love it at the same time. Keats: "&lt;span class="st"&gt;I have been half in love with easeful Death." But it's all about the "have been." You've got to put it behind you. You've got to put your old self behind you. You don't have to remain faithful to a you that wasn't fully formed. Blake: "The cut worm forgives the plow."&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;So &lt;span class="st"&gt;now it's time to get back into the swing of things. I want to look today at 'Calculations: A Love Poem' by &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/gary-fincke" target="_blank"&gt;Gary Fincke&lt;/a&gt;. This one comes from the &lt;/span&gt;*&lt;a href="http://www.nereview.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New England Review&lt;/a&gt;*, Vol. 34, the same place I got the two Russian poems that we read on Translation Thursdays (&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-jolt-by-anna-semyonovna-prismanova.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/beads-by-olga-sedakova.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). So here's 'Calculations: A Love Poem':
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;span class="st"&gt;The billionth digit of pi is 9,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;The last month without a full moon,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;February, 1865—&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;This morning I am making a list&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;Of the last lines of parables&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;About the work of numbers, about&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;Calculations, marking the speed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;With which blood travels, as if three feet&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;Per second were like the blessings&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;On the late workers in a vineyard&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;Or a son just home from living with swine.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="st"&gt;Someone continues the division&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;That computes the decimals of pi—&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;He is telling a story, numerals&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;Spilling out toward infinity,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;The counting a language, a life&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;Beyond this one, as difficult&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;To believe as the number of hours&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;We've slept together, darkness returning&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;And vanishing, the moments, nightly, &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;Between your breaths, the hesitations&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;In your deep sleep; my own held breath,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;Listening, and then, temporarily&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;Believed, turning toward the window,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;Reciting the autonomic lesson&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;Of your lungs that swell and shrink&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;At last, in rhythm, their vital&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;Capacity, in liters, 3.1.

—&lt;/span&gt; Gary Fincke, *&lt;a href="http://www.nereview.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New England Review&lt;/a&gt;*, Vol. 34, Number 3-4, ©2014,&amp;nbsp; p.333&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;span class="st"&gt;Pi is an irrational number. It unfolds in a strange but orderly fashion forever. To try to compute pi is to try to make sense of the irrational that — who knows how or why — simply *is*. Of course language does the same thing. Counting is a language just as language is sort of counting or, as Walt Whitman would put it, a "tally." To give something a word, to acknowledge something by its name, is a way of counting it.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="st"&gt;So what does that have to do with love? God's love is a form of counting. He knows the number of hairs on your head. He keeps careful track of the generations. We tend to see numbers as scientific, cold, abstract, but in the language of the Bible numbers often hold an organic, human significance. They are a sign of connectedness rather than difference and distance.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="st"&gt;Human love is likewise a form of counting. We say that the person we're meant to be with is "the one." The people we love are the people who "count." Fincke takes this a step further: he counts his beloved in scientific terms, playing with that troubling space between knowing someone and *knowing *someone. The degree that it inevitably makes us uncomfortable — the precise speed of blood through the veins, the volume of air that the lungs can contain — lets us &lt;b&gt;*feel our understanding of what poetry is*&lt;/b&gt;. Ending a poem with the number "3.1" (the first two digits of pi) just feels *wrong*, like some crucial boundary has been crossed.* *We might say that the poem fails because of it, but isn't that exactly the point? Doesn't that tell us something about love, about our expectations as poetry-readers of what love *should *be? Love *should be* lots of things, but maybe it's more important to every now and then count out precisely what love *is*. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/calculations-love-poem-by-gary-fincke.html" data-text="Reading 'Calculations: A Love Poem' by Gary Fincke in @NERweb" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F09%2Fcalculations-love-poem-by-gary-fincke.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Workin' It</title>
  <content type='html'>I've been writing here for coming up on three months. There have been some hits, there have been some misses. I'm gonna talk a bit about views and hits in the next few paragraphs. It's not like that's all that matters to me, but as someone working toward becoming an editor and a writer I can't pretend I'm not interested in the question of *what people want*. I'm trying to figure out how to survive on the internet. And I figure some of you are, too, so I want to share some of the things that have worked for me. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most popular post I've done was actually last week's post about &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/vowels-by-christian-bok.html" target="_blank"&gt;'Vowels' by Christian Bök&lt;/a&gt;. I mean just in terms of numbers, this one has *by far* the most views of any post I've done. What made the difference is that the poet tweeted about it twice. When a publishing house or journal tweets about you, you get a tiny bump at best. When a poet tweets about you, though, the numbers jump dramatically. The same thing happened with my posts about &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/country-music-by-michael-robbins.html" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Robbins' 'Country Music'&lt;/a&gt; and Diane Seuss's &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/still-life-with-two-dead-peacocks-and.html" target="_blank"&gt;'Still-Life with Two Dead Peacocks and a Girl (after Rembrandt)'&lt;/a&gt;. In all of these cases I tagged the authors when promoting the post on Twitter. I was worried at first that they might be upset by my putting their work online, but all of them have seemed pleased. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second-most-popular post so far was &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/glass-box-by-sandra-simonds.html" target="_blank"&gt;'Glass Box' by Sandra Simonds&lt;/a&gt;. With this one I didn't even include the whole poem, but I think the graphics I included made the difference. I'm a bit lazy with the graphics sometimes, but there's a decent correlation between having a graphic and getting 30 hits rather than 15. This was also the first post I did that received Facebook traffic. The effectiveness of Facebook has pushed me to add the &lt;a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button" target="_blank"&gt;handy Like/Share buttons&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of each post. There's &lt;a href="https://about.twitter.com/resources/buttons" target="_blank"&gt;a similar service for Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've also been slowly learning that readers want more of the same. If they started following along because of the poetry, give them more poetry. My mini-essays have not gone over well. Nobody particularly seems to care. I don't regret writing them, but I'll probably be less inclined in the future to indulge in them. (And yes, I recognize the irony of saying all this in a poetry-free post.) This sounds a little disheartening, but really it shouldn't be. It means that you need to refine and own your voice, and always be true to it. If you give people your best, they'll reward you by *wanting* your best. Whenever I sign onto a blog, I'm ready and willing to be impressed. I want to be *captivated*, to find something that's worth coming back to. There can be no *off days*; you have to always write like your reader has never heard of you before. Which is very near always the case with my readers, I'm sure. It's still probably true for even the big literature bloggers like &lt;a href="http://tonysreadinglist.blogspot.com/"&gt;Tony Malone &lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href="http://conversationalreading.com/"&gt;Scott Esposito&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I look forward to more. As I've commented before, this has been a tough week for writing for some reason. I'm sure the weekend ahead will help me recharge. But really, on the days when writing felt impossible, the thing that helped the most was — writing! I would literally write:  &lt;blockquote&gt;"This is so hard. I don't know how to tell you about this part of the poem. I don't know how to say it. The poet seems to be doing X, Y, and Z."&lt;/blockquote&gt; Then I would go back and erase everything before "The poet seems...." Terribly inefficient but it works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until next week. :-)</content>

  <title type='text'>'Le Zèbre' by Robert Desnos</title>
  <content type='html'>Robert Desnos. Have you heard of Robert Desnos? I'll summarize &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Desnos" target="_blank"&gt;from the wiki article&lt;/a&gt;. He was a leading member of the Surrealist movement in early 20th century Paris. He was arrested by the Gestapo for his membership in the French Résistance, and he was sent first to Auschwitz and then to Theresienstadt, where he died of typhoid. Here's a story told by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Griffin" target="_blank"&gt;Susan Griffin&lt;/a&gt; (from her essay, &lt;a href="http://thetyee.ca/Citizentoolkit/2004/11/15/CanImagSaveUs/" target="_blank"&gt;'Can the Imagination Save Us'&lt;/a&gt;) about Desnos's last days:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Even in the grimmest of circumstances, a shift in perspective can  create startling change. I am thinking of a story I heard a few years  ago from my friend Odette, a writer and a survivor of the holocaust.  Along with many others who crowd the bed of a large truck, she tells me,  the surrealist poet Robert Desnos is being taken away from the barracks  of the concentration camp where he has been held prisoner. Leaving the  barracks, the mood is somber; everyone knows the truck is headed for the  gas chambers. And when the truck arrives no one can speak at all; even  the guards fall silent. But this silence is soon interrupted by an  energetic man, who jumps into the line and grabs one of the condemned.  Improbable as it is, Odette told me, Desnos reads the man's palm.

Oh, he says, I see you have a very long  lifeline. And you are going to have three children. He is exuberant. And  his excitement is contagious. First one man, then another, offers up  his hand, and the prediction is for longevity, more children, abundant  joy.

As Desnos reads more palms, not only does  the mood of the prisoners change but that of the guards too. How can one  explain it? Perhaps the element of surprise has planted a shadow of  doubt in their minds. If hey told themselves these deaths were  inevitable, this no longer seems inarguable. They are in any case so  disoriented by this sudden change of mood among those they are about to  kill that they are unable to go through with the executions. So all the  men, along with Desnos, are packed back onto the truck and taken back to  the barracks.

Here's 'Le Zèbre', by Robert Desnos:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Le zèbre, cheval des ténèbres
Lève le pied, ferme les yeux
Et fait résonner ses vertèbres
En hennisant d'un air joyeux.

Au clair soleil de Barbarie,
Il sort alors de l'écurie
Et va brouter dans la prairie
Les herbes de sorcellerie.

Mais la prison, sur son pelage,
A laissé l'ombre du grillage.

---

The zebra, horse of darkness,
lifts its foot, closes its eyes
and sets its backbone reverberating
with its joyful neighing.

In the bright Barbary sunlight,
he emerges then from the stable
and goes grazing in the grasslands
on the weeds of sorcery.

But the prison, on his coat,
has left the shadow of its bars.

— Adapted from the prose translation by William Rees, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Penguin-Book-French-Poetry/dp/0140423850" target="_blank"&gt;The Penguin Book of French Poetry, 1820 - 1950&lt;/a&gt;, William Rees ed., Penguin Books, ©1990, p.760&lt;/blockquote&gt;The French rhymes and has a bouncy rhythm that the English doesn't capture. That bounciness and the sense of freedom and exuberance that come in the first two quatrains are supposed to stand in stark contrast to the sombre final couplet. 'The stable / l'écurie' becomes 'la prison.' It's a jolt. This is and is not an animal poem. It operates along the same lines as Ted Hughes's &lt;a href="http://www.richardwebster.net/tedhughes.html" target="_blank"&gt;'The Thought-Fox'&lt;/a&gt;: capturing the animal's essence for the sake of illustrating some abstract principle, not for the sake of observing nature.

I want to talk about the allegory, but it's so universal that I don't know I can settle on any one context that best fits it. Freedom is tainted by captivity. That's the whole tragic truth of it. Whether it's the freedom of artistic creation, freedom from one's past or one's responsibilities, freedom from political oppression: captivity leaves its mark. Having been captive becomes a part of us, indelible and inextricable. When injustice comes it comes forever; even forgiveness can't erase the past.

  <title type='text'>'In Memory of my Future' by Norma Cole</title>
  <content type='html'>Today I'm reading 'In Memory of my Future' by Norma Cole, from that Norton Anthology of  *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Postmodern-American-Poetry-Anthology-Edition/dp/0393341860" target="_blank"&gt;Postmodern American Poetry&lt;/a&gt; *I've been reading for the last several weeks. Cole, like &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/vowels-by-christian-bok.html" target="_blank"&gt;Christian Bök&lt;/a&gt;, was born in Toronto; later in life she moved to San Francisco and became part of &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/often-i-am-permitted-to-return-to.html" target="_blank"&gt;Robert Duncan&lt;/a&gt;'s circle. It's interesting to me how much literary movements live and die by friendships and rivalries in a relatively close geographical and social space. Did I really just write that sentence? What I mean to say is: history is made by groups of like-minded individuals hanging out, getting high, getting mad at each other, being mad together, falling in love with each other, falling out of love with each other, and all the while making art. It happens in cities large and small. Rome. Paris. New York. San Francisco. Concord. Black Mountain. Each body of text is always a gathering of influences, always more than just text or the product of texts.

I think this poem is about language's insufficiency, or language's state of exile from the world. I don't want to get of myself. (Well, sure I do. But I shouldn't.) Here's 'In Memory of my Future' by Norma Cole:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Statement is already exaggeration, migration, inclusion, the film itself become the fuse. Confusion in general or at least mutual, no longer or not yet.

The thought of dust tightens the cords. A task is perceived as a symbol of inevitability, caesura seeing it through for what it is.

It doesn't lend itself to explanation, sealed in the world, letter become life at the limit of memory.

— Norma Cole, *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Postmodern-American-Poetry-Anthology-Edition/dp/0393341860" target="_blank"&gt;Postmodern American Poetry&lt;/a&gt;*, Paul Hoover, editor, ©2013, W.W. Norton and Company, Inc, p.386 &lt;/blockquote&gt;It's formally interesting, of course. The lines are unbroken, like three elegant brush-strokes. Anything that calls itself a poem but then refuses to use traditional lines and stanzas is trying to say something about form. Which is fitting, since I think even a cursory reading will tell us that the subject of the poem is "statement" as such. The act of stating things, the idea of the act of stating things: this is our poem's subject.

So what is "statement"? It's not exact, that's for sure. Statement is slippery. It always misses its mark. It eats itself up; it self-destructs. Anytime you say "X is Y" you're at best very close to the truth, but not quite there. A statement is always too early or too late. "It doesn't lend itself to explanation" — but what else is it for?

What is "a task"? A statement disguising itself as action. We say "I will do X" and we think it's inevitable. "Caesura" — the natural pauses that come as we move through a poem or move through life — see this task statement through / see it for what it is. Without jumps and gaps in time we could never get anything done; from the perspective of these jumps and gaps the statement "I will do X" is laughable. As though we could know what we will do!

Or as though we could know what we have done, who we are, who we were, who we will be. The statement is "sealed in the world". That's probably the most important little phrase, right there. The world contains the statement, and not the other way around. Even the aggregate of all statements wouldn't contain the world. Statement as such is contained; it's just one of many things the world keeps in its toy chest.

Is a poem a statement?

I feel overwhelmed by this poem, though I love it, too. It's so small and I don't understand it, but I feel *attached to it *somehow. I think I've talked here before about the beauty of the sensation of the presence of meaning even without the understanding of that meaning.

I'm tired. Like really and thoroughly tired. Writing, these last few days, has been very difficult. I'm going through a period of really awful self-doubt. And honestly a lot of that has to do with the fact that I got no sleep on Sunday night. Younger, less mature Tim would have given in to that feeling and done something rash. Made an important change. Freaked out a bit. But I — older and slightly more put together — am able to a degree to detach myself from my affect. I keep pushing, even though I don't want to, because I know I'll kick myself for it later. Or at least I think I will. I can't see that statement through for what it really is.

Oy. Tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/in-memory-of-my-future-by-norma-cole.html" data-text="Reading a poem by Norma Cole" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F09%2Fin-memory-of-my-future-by-norma-cole.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Dandelions (II)' by Henri Cole</title>
  <content type='html'>Today I want to read 'Dandelions (II)' by Henri Cole, from &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/toc/2442" target="_blank"&gt;the newest issue of *Poetry Magazine*&lt;/a&gt;. (You know that by following that link you can read the entire issue for free, right? Worth a look.) Unfortunately I wasn't a huge fan of this latest issue. It's got a big John Ashbery feature and, yeah, I just don't enjoy John Ashbery. Ashbery fans probably sneer at the word 'enjoy' but I don't care. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girolamo_Mei"&gt;Girolamo Mei &lt;/a&gt;created opera because church music left him feeling nothing. Ancient Greek texts told him he *should feel something* when he listened to music, and he believed them. So he and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentine_Camerata"&gt;the Florentine Camerata &lt;/a&gt;recreated Greek music as they thought it must have been. So you can tell me Ashbery is saying interesting things about Lacan; I'm sure Palestrina was saying interesting things about Christian theology. So I'll learn what I can about Ashbery, and keep an open mind that maybe someday I might enjoy his poetry, but until then I'll follow my intuition toward the poetry that moves me.

OK, now for Henri Cole. This is 'Dandelions (II)'. I couldn't find the first 'Dandelions' poem online. Must be &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Henri-Cole/e/B001IXMPUQ"&gt;in one of Henri Cole's books&lt;/a&gt;? In any case, here's the poem. It's a pretty heavy one, so, you know: brace yourself.
&lt;blockquote&gt;He drew
these dandelions
during one
of the days
when the only

solace
was derived
from the labor
of getting
the white stems

and blurry seed heads
just right. “Nobody there,”
the new disease
announced,
with black-tie gloom,

“nobody there,”
after he’d succumbed.
Sometimes,
sleeping soundly
is almost

unbearable.
Please take
care of me,
he asked,
as they put

his crayons
with his wallet
in a box
by the stove.
In the distance,

beyond the tulips,
an insect chorus
droned:
we beat you up;
we beat you up.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So there's a structure at work here — seven five-line stanzas — but not a rhythm or a rhyme. It reads like prose that's had line-breaks thrown in randomly. That's an OK tactic. It used to bother me but now I think: yeah, some times in life feel disjointed, arbitrarily broken up into small bits that don't necessarily make any sense. The situation Cole is trying to (not) talk about here seems like one of those moments. In really sad times — the death of a loved one, the departure of a dear friend — it seems like some force is shoving you reluctantly away from the better days of the past. You stumble, you falter, you are miserable, you are bored, but you always keep moving forward.

Is it a child who is sick, dying, dead? We might think so at first because of the drawing dandelions, because of the crayons, but "his wallet" suggests someone older. The sufferer takes "solace" in the "labor" of art. Attention to reality's small details becomes — through art — a welcome distraction from reality.

There are a couple points here that I find really interesting. The anthropomorphized disease is given words in quotes, but the person suffering from that disease is only quoted indirectly, without quotation marks. Possibly the speaker can't stand to engage with the level of abstraction the quotation marks imply. The quotation marks imply a considered distance; they acknowledge separation. By refusing the quotation marks, the speaker is making the suffering one's words his own. It is an act of empathy.

The second point is that set of four lines: "Sometimes, / sleeping soundly / is almost // unbearable." Is the speaker saying this as someone who has to watch another suffer? I think that's what's happening. You feel guilty being well sometimes when someone you love is sick. You feel sick that you're not sick in their place, that you can't take it away from them and into yourself. As an empathetic person, "sleeping soundly / is almost // unbearable."

And then finally, what a movement at the end. "In the distance, // beyond the tulips," is this jolting leap away from the intimate, almost breathless space we've been occupying. The drone of the chorus — like the chorus in a Greek tragedy. Insects just *are*. The drone of insects just *is*. And all these things that persist, all these things that unlike the suffering one in this poem *will not go away*, are a painful reminder of impermanence. The lasting things make us hurt for the things that are dying. A good sleep makes us hurt for those who can't get a good sleep.

Well that's about as much punch-in-the-gut sadness as I can take for one day. Right? I didn't expect this poem to be quite so sad, but damn. It just aches. I'm gonna go get some dinner with my wife. Some Chinese food; that will cheer me up. Until tomorrow, amigos. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/dandelions-ii-by-henri-cole.html" data-text="Reading the poem 'Dandelions (II)' by Henri Cole in @poetrymagazine" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F09%2Fdandelions-ii-by-henri-cole.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'In Case of Complete Reversal' by Kay Ryan</title>
  <content type='html'>I took a red-eye from Los Angeles to Boston last night and got about two hours of sleep. I'm a bit of a wreck. I have absolutely no desire to write today which is why I absolutely have to write today no matter what. So here's 'In Case of Complete Reversal' by Kay Ryan, from the new &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/toc/2442" target="_blank"&gt;September issue of *Poetry Magazine*&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Born into each seed
is a small anti-seed
useful in case of some
complete reversal:
a tiny but powerful
kit for adapting it
to the unimaginable.
If we could crack the
fineness of the shell
we’d see the
bundled minuses
stacked as in a safe,
ready for use
if things don’t
go well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In terms of image, this is a fairly straightforward poem. A seed within a seed, and within that seed "bundled minuses", whatever that might mean. Little floating hyphens. Invisible electrons with their negative charges.

But what is the seed, and how is it related to the way "things" "go"? A seed is a beginning, the smallest unit out of which our futures can emerge. So each beginning contains its opposite, so each beginning is not just itself but its own negation. All beginnings are adaptable to their own failure — to our failure.

I like the poem's symbolic texture. You know throughout that the seed is  only a very tenuous connection to the point the poet is trying to make.  These seeds hardly resemble real seeds in any way. They're vessels for  an idea. This means the poem plays itself out in a different part of the  imagination than poems that more actively engage the senses. It's a  poem of intellectual movement. Your mind moves with the poem more than  your eye does. The poem is an order of thoughts aided by images rather  than an order of images that imply thoughts. It's an interesting  distinction to make between and within poems.

I have become well-acquainted with failure in the twenty-nine years I've been alive. It's taken me nearly thirty years to learn that failure can be just part of the journey to success and is not always a sign from the universe that you don't belong. Or maybe there are failures that are a sign that you don't belong, but there's a good kind of failure too, a failure that's a challenge that you should accept, a failure that's a dark wood at the beginning of a long journey toward the light. Learning how to accept failures or to put failures behind you is difficult, but it's not impossible, and it's worth learning how to do. Every beginning contains what's needed to get over a reversal of fortune.

That's about as much juice as my sleepless brain can squeeze from this lemon. (I like lemon juice; it's a good thing.) Tomorrow I'll be well rested and my thoughts will be more clear. But I'm glad I've written. I'm glad I didn't give up on today. Alright then. Until tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/in-case-of-complete-reversal-by-kay-ryan.html" data-text="Reading Kay Ryan in the September 2014 @poetrymagazine" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F09%2Fin-case-of-complete-reversal-by-kay-ryan.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>The Cost of Good Reading</title>
  <content type='html'>Keeping up on the newest poetry can be expensive. If you're on a budget, you've *really *got to choose where and how you read. Here's a table I put together of how much it would cost to get a year's subscription to each of the top ten &lt;a href="http://cliffordgarstang.com/?p=4329" target="_blank"&gt;2014 Pushcart Prize-winning journals&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;table border="2" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; width: 395px;"&gt; &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;Poetry &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;11   issues&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;$35.00 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;The Kenyon Review&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;4 issues&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;$30.00 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;American Poetry Review&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;6 issues&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;$20.00 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;Ploughshares&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;3 issues&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;$35.00 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;The Georgia Review&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;4 issues&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;$40.00 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;The Threepenny Review&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;4 issues&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;$25.00 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;The New England Review&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;4 issues&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;$30.00 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;The Virginia Quarterly Review&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;4 issues&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;$32.00 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;The Southern Review&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;4 issues&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;$40.00 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;Field&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;2 issues&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;$16.00 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Total (before tax and shipping)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt; ---&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$303.00&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
I would pay for an *American Poetry Review *subscription. It has a great mix of criticism and poetry, and at $20 for 6 issues it's a really good deal.

I like *The New England Review* and *Ploughshares* well enough, but not enough of their content is geared toward my tastes and interests that I would commit $65 a year to them. I'd rather get them at the library, even if that means waiting a while after the initial publication date of each issue.

(Have you looked at your local library for poetry resources? They might have great stuff there in print, and they might have electronic access to some of the top journals. With a bit of searching I found that I can read the current and even the back issues of most of the top journals &lt;u&gt;for free&lt;/u&gt; through&lt;b&gt;* *&lt;/b&gt;my local library's website. Do some looking around.)

There's also a question of advocacy. Sure I could plunk down the money for a powerhouse publication like *Ploughshares*, but wouldn't my money mean more to a smaller (and, for me personally, more interesting) operation like &lt;a href="http://www.musicandliterature.org/subscribe/" target="_blank"&gt;*Music &amp;amp; Literature*&lt;/a&gt;? Putting my money there would give me the feeling of being part of something more intimate; it's a literary *and *a political choice.

They aren't all 'just literary journals' any more than *The National Review* and *The Nation* are 'just news magazines'. *&lt;b&gt;In the rush to cheer-lead for poetry as a genre many of us forget that poetry takes many forms and is produced and distributed in more or less fair ways. You can support the best practices with your dollars&lt;/b&gt;*. Vote for your favorite poetry with your praise, yes. We need more people doing serious thinking and talking and writing about poetry. But also vote with your dollars. Give praise with your dollars. Let your dollars be thoughtful dollars. For just $25 you can tell *The Threepenny Review* that you love what they're doing, and in return they'll give you more of that good stuff. That's what it costs to read good things. That's what it costs to be a good reader.

  <title type='text'>'Vowels' by Christian Bök</title>
  <content type='html'>If you're like me and you like knowing what books are coming out in the next month or two or you have a hard time keeping up with the books that have already come out in the last several months, then you should take a look through &lt;a href="http://poems.com/pubs_noted.php" target="_blank"&gt;Poetry Daily's Publications Noted and Received list&lt;/a&gt;. It's a great way to keep up on the latest poetry news. Most books are linked directly to Amazon, so you can add them to your Amazon Wish List and tell your family and friends, "Buy me these things, if you really love me."

Speaking of poetry news, I need to rely less on Twitter for poetry news. Most times when the subject of poetry appears on Twitter, it's just another article about the World War I poets or why we should appreciate Homer. Any time they cover a living poet it's got a very serious-faced black-and-white photo of the poet, very austere looking so that you can reasonably assume the poet is wise and good and heroically thankfully dead. Nobody's talking about living poets, the poets who right now are trying to make something great or have real fun. There are a lot of posers out there, for sure. Maybe that task of wading through the posers discourages people who go looking for *the real thing *in contemporary poetry. But that's how it's always been. You think Homer didn't know a bunch of posers? You think he didn't roll into Megara and sigh that everybody was listening to some poet named Cleomenes and not him? But on the other hand you think he didn't step into some little house party in Thebes and hear an amazing poet and just go "Wow!" and go up to him after the show and say "Hey man, sounds good." And that poet is lost to history now, but that "wow" lives on. There ought to be a tomb for the unknown poet, inscribed with the word "wow". But that "wow" ought to be given to the living, too. We owe a debt of praise to the living poets worthy of that name.

Ugh. "Debt of praise"? I'm being too dramatic. Let's get to the poetry.

OK, today I want to look at a playful poem called 'Vowels' by the Canadian poet Christian Bök. I found this one in the Norton Anthology of *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Postmodern-American-Poetry-Anthology-Edition/dp/0393341860" target="_blank"&gt;Postmodern American Poetry&lt;/a&gt;* (I've also read a poem by &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/often-i-am-permitted-to-return-to.html" target="_blank"&gt;Robert Duncan&lt;/a&gt; from this anthology). I'm still trying to *get* what postmodernism is. I could venture some ideas about capitalism, about resisting meta-narratives, about undermining the political assumptions that hold language together and that language holds together, but I'm pretty sure that everything I said would be wrong.

So here's 'Vowels':
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;loveless vessels

we vow
solo love

we see
love solve loss

else we see
love sow woe

selves we woo
we lose

losses we levee
we owe

we sell
loose vows

so we love
less well

so low
so level

wolves evolve

— Christian Bök, *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Postmodern-American-Poetry-Anthology-Edition/dp/0393341860" target="_blank"&gt;Postmodern American Poetry&lt;/a&gt;*, Paul Hoover, editor, ©2013, W.W. Norton and Company, Inc, p.771&lt;/blockquote&gt;You see what Bök has done, yeah?

It's an anagrammatic poem. The entire poem is composed with the letters v, o, w, e, l, and s. As a poem about love and love's inversion it has some interesting thing to say, but none of those (at first) seem as interesting as the form itself. We see the arbitrariness of language. We get the sense that, though it might be hard, we can construct any meaning out of any combination of letters. It's the poets intention that drives letters into place, and the reader determines whether those letters in that order (with just the right spaces in between) are *good *or *bad*.

But this is beyond just aesthetic judgment. A phrase like "wolves evolve" is *good* English. It has the stamp of approval from the English language. But something like "vlle wvo" doesn't get that stamp of approval. English says, "No, that doesn't belong. There's no historical precedent for it, and nobody now living would recognize it as anything but gibberish." As playful as Bök's poem might seem, it is held tightly in check by societal pressures. So we see, through the game of the anagram, that &lt;b&gt;*all words and phrases are shaped by historical and living communities of language*&lt;/b&gt;.

Now think about that in terms of love. "we vow / solo love" and "we sell / loose vows". Promises are just made of words, combinations of sounds and letters. We learn the words for promises from other speakers of our language. We learn the words and the letters that make the words, but we don't necessarily have *the substance *to really *make *promises. Without some force outside the letter, outside the word, without some true intention, these words are "loveless vessels". And in short time "wolves evolve".

Just one word for this kind of poem: wow.

Until tomorrow, all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/09/vowels-by-christian-bok.html" data-text="&amp;quot;we see / love solve loss // else we see / love sow woe&amp;quot; Reading 'Vowels' by @christianbok" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F09%2Fvowels-by-christian-bok.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Slow Learner: In the Garden' by Christopher Buckley</title>
  <content type='html'>Christopher Buckley has the wrong name. He's the author of over twenty books, but you won't find any of them on the first page of Amazon search results because there's a famous novelist also named Christopher Buckley. If you're looking for the poet's new book, *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Back-Room-at-Philosophers-Club/dp/1622880692" target="_blank"&gt;Back Room at the Philosopher's Club&lt;/a&gt;*, you'll have to continue onto the second page of search results. Even on the Goodreads page for one of the poet's anthologies, *&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/790991.How_Much_Earth" target="_blank"&gt;How Much Earth: The Fresno Poets&lt;/a&gt;*, they give the bio for the novelist.

Ugh. I hate this sort of thing. When I arrived at Yale, there was already another Timothy Ellison in my department. I'd show up to meetings with professors and they would be expecting the other guy. People would angrily ask me why I hadn't answered their emails and I would have to explain that they probably sent it to the wrong Timothy Ellison. I met the other Tim; he's a really nice guy. But it got old fast. Reminds me (a little) of this cartoon:

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lph0u1p8bi1qfvq9bo1_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lph0u1p8bi1qfvq9bo1_1280.jpg" height="332" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
What do you do at that point? You let it go, I guess. Or you try to do more with your name than the other guy. But if you're a poet against a famous novelist, you're better off letting it go.

So enough small talk. I want to look at this poem 'Slow Learner: In the Garden', one of two poems by Buckley in *&lt;a href="http://www.zyzzyva.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Zyzzyva&lt;/a&gt;* no. 100. It's a very classical feeling poem. To me it feels like one of Coleridge's conversational poems or Wordsworth's epitaph poems (well, they're *all *epitaph poems, aren't they?). It bears repeated and slow reading. It addresses big themes through small movements in imagery and register, which is how I like poems. I'm not crazy about poems that wave their arms in the air shouting, "Look at me, Ma!" Anyway, here's the first page of the poem. It's a big poem so I don't want to give the whole thing away, and I think this is a really representative sample of the whole:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am a slow study, apparently
nothing for it ... but I'm happy to be at my lessons,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in the particulars, the thorns
or petals, mildew or rust—my doctorate taken in vagary,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in staring off at the ivory bells
of yucca in a breeze. I admire clarity, the high, hard edge
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of oxygen, and yet the formless
beauty, the heady embellishment of orange blossoms—
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;promises that will not apply
in terms of October. The arithmetic of wind—simple plus
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;or minus, everything
blowing away ... our last warnings in the eucalyptus
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;dry from the air down,
the untranslatable borders, sweet peas on the trellis
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;red and magenta, bruises
dividing the sky. I've come up with next to nothing
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;given the hours spent
observing the plumbago braid itself on air, multiply among
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the pittosporum and pyracantha.

Now and then I have the good sense to listen to
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the red sandstone and granite
of the Santa Ynez range, of the San Rafaels, a quiet
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;called for by the insatiable
light from here to Istanbul, where I still see Nazim Hikmet
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;picking an apple in the yard
of that rundown house, in the stuttering poverty of his heart.

— from 'Slow Learner: In the Garden' by Christopher Buckley, *&lt;a href="http://www.zyzzyva.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Zyzzyva&lt;/a&gt;*, no. 100, ©2014, p.158&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The thing to watch is how your mind moves from sentence to sentence, image to image, line to line. Early on he sets a personal, humorous tone. He declares himself a student of small materialities, and pursues that train of thought through blossoms, wind, trees, peas on their trellises, shades of color in the sky, (and notice it's all air, air, air), and finally ends with those two mouthfuls: "pittosporum and pyracantha." You're being guided through a poetics. He shows you what he's all about as a poet even as he demonstrates it.

So why does the stanza break after "pittosporum and pyracantha"? Because his thought has reached its limit. He says he's a student of materials and the images of materials, but as he pursues that thought he comes to a threshold of pure language. The words "pittosporum and pyracantha" are extremely exact *as language*, but they do nothing to convey image. There's a separation between the word and the thing, or the common mind's ability to link the word to the thing. The visual and the verbal are at cross-purposes. So the stanza breaks, and he explores a new angle.

"Now and then I have the good sense to listen to" ... To what? It's a good exercise to try and fill in the blank at the end of a line. What do you expect to come next? Birds? The wind? A song? Your guess probably isn't "the red sandstone and granite / of the Santa Ynez range, of the San Rafaels". It's a strangely synaesthetic answer. How do you listen to stone? What is there to hear? He's pushing at the limits of our understanding. The sound of stone and the image of an obscure word like "pittosporum" are each at the edge of sense.

And from here we move to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A2z%C4%B1m_Hikmet" target="_blank"&gt;Nazim Hikmet&lt;/a&gt;. Barring some extreme twists of fate, Buckley simply couldn't have seen Hikmet in Turkey. The poetic eye has drifted from the realest of the real to the imaginary, the solitary figure in a land the poet probably hasn't been to. And who is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A2z%C4%B1m_Hikmet" target="_blank"&gt;Nazim Hikmet&lt;/a&gt;? A political poet. An exiled poet. A suffering poet. Can you see the way Buckley is testing himself? Straining at the edges of his craft? Doubting the worth and purpose of his poetry even as he writes it? Wordsworth does something so similar in "Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey":
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The day is come when I again repose
Here, under this dark sycamore, and view
These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,
Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,
Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves
'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see
These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines
Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,
Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke
Sent up, in silence, from among the trees!
With some uncertain notice, as might seem
Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,
Or of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire
The Hermit sits alone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Buckley's poem is just right: the didactic but friendly pace, the combination of familiarity and strangeness, the richness of imagery and sound, the respect for the sentence and the line. Just the qualities that, for me, make a poem great.

Buy yourself a copy of *&lt;a href="http://www.zyzzyva.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Zyzzyva&lt;/a&gt; *and read the whole poem*. *Buy yourself a copy of *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Back-Room-at-Philosophers-Club/dp/1622880692" target="_blank"&gt;Back Room at the Philosopher's Club&lt;/a&gt;*, which includes this poem*.* Support poets you like with your dollars.

  <title type='text'>Labor Day</title>
  <content type='html'>My wife and I just spent most of our day in a rental Volkswagen Jetta, traveling from Quebec to Boston. We made a lot of stops along the way to look at historical sites (and because -- lucky us -- the border patrol selected our car for a random inspection), so it took roughly nine and a half hours to get home. That's a long day.

Some days feel so un-poetry that they're poetry, you know? No, maybe that doesn't make any sense. It's just when you stop at the swamps at the foot of Mount Bigelow and you feel the sun pressing on your skin and in your hair and the smell of mud is so damn thick in your nostrils and the only sound you hear is the constant scree of insects and the crush and crish of your own footsteps in the dirt and the splash of a yellow Labrador retriever jumping into the clear water it's hard not to think of it as a poetic experience. It's poetic because it's small, it's private, it's not something you could make a movie about or tie into a popular novel in an especially interesting way. It wouldn't fit very well into a song, and it would be hard to paint, so it's poetic. It's jagged and real but dreamlike and universal, so it's poetic. And all of what I've just written is probably bullshit, but that's also part of what makes it poetic.
&lt;br/&gt;And it's an experience I wouldn't give up for anything. That makes it poetry. &lt;br/&gt;
And now I'm going to get some sleep before starting a new day. OK, I'm actually going to do some work and then get to sleep, but none of that (Hurray!) will be in a car. That's poetic too. That's all part of it.</content>

  <title type='text'>'Christ en Croix' by Émile Nelligan</title>
  <content type='html'>My wife and I are in Montreal today; we got here late last night. It's strange speaking French only about five hours north of home. The only other places I've spoken French are college classes and (of course) France. It's had me wondering about the relationship between French and English here. How does a Quebecois's French impact her or his English, and vice versa?&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I'll get to the point. I've got work to do tonight; a *lot *of work. So I can't spend as long as I usually do putting this blog post together. So here, in the spirit of Montreal and Quebecois poetry and all things Canadian, is a the poem 'Christ en Croix' by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Nelligan" target="_blank"&gt;Émile Nelligan&lt;/a&gt;, followed by an English translation of the same by (according to wikipedia) Konrad Bongard. My French isn't the best, but even I can tell that it's a *very *loose translation. But enjoy anyway. And really, do yourself a favor and read up on the incomparable &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Nelligan" target="_blank"&gt;Émile Nelligan&lt;/a&gt;.Until next week!
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Je remarquais toujours ce grand Jésus de plâtre
Dressé comme un pardon au seuil du vieux couvent,
Échafaud solennel à geste noir, devant
Lequel je me courbais, saintement idolâtre.

Or, l'autre soir, à l'heure où le cri-cri folâtre,
Par les prés assombris, le regard bleu rêvant,
Récitant Eloa, les cheveux dans le vent,
Comme il sied à l'Éphèbe esthétique et bellâtre,

J'aperçus, adjoignant des débris de parois,
Un gigantesque amas de lourde vieille croix
Et de plâtre écroulé parmi les primevères;

Et je restai là, morne, avec les yeux pensifs,
Et j'entendais en moi des marteaux convulsifs
Renfoncer les clous noirs des intimes Calvaires!

----

The gypsum Jesus always stalled me in my steps
Like a curse at the old convent door;
Crouching meekly, I bend to exalt an idol
Whose forgiveness I do not implore.

Not long ago, at the crickets' hour, I roamed dim
Meadows in a restful reverie
Reciting 'Eloa', with my hair worn by the wind
And no audience save for the trees.

But now, as I lie with knees bent beneath Christ's scaffold,
I see his crumbling mortar cross
With its plaster buried in the roses, and am saddened -

For if I listen close enough, I can almost hear
The sound of coal-black nails being wrung in
To his wrists, the savage piercing of Longinus' spear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'The Jolt' by Anna Semyonovna Prismanova</title>
  <content type='html'>Today I'm reading 'The Jolt' by Russian poet Anna Semyonovna Prismanova (1892–1960), translated by UCLA professor Boris Drayluk for the *&lt;a href="http://www.nereview.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New England Review&lt;/a&gt;* &lt;a href="http://www.nereview.com/back-issues/vol-34-2013-2014/volume-34-no-3-4-2014/" target="_blank"&gt;double issue&lt;/a&gt; that came out this spring. It's short and sweet, so I'll get right to it. Here's 'The Jolt':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The jolt must come from far away:
the start of bread is in the grain.
A stream, although still underground,
aspires to reflect the sky.

A future Sunday's distant light
reaches us early in the week.
The jolt must come from far away
to trigger earthquakes in the heart.

A shoulder alien to me
controls the movement of my hand.
In order to acquire such strength,
the jolt must come from far away.

— Anna Semyonovna Prismanova, trans. Boris Drayluk, *&lt;a href="http://www.nereview.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New England Review&lt;/a&gt;*, Vol. 34, Number 3-4, ©2014,&amp;nbsp; p.147&lt;/blockquote&gt;With a poem this short, it can feel like there's no room for movement. Nothing is happening by the end that wasn't already happening at the beginning. Take this poem by A.E. Housman, for example:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Stars, I have seen them fall,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But when they drop and die
No star is lost at all
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;From all the star-sown sky.
The toil of all that be
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Helps not the primal fault;
It rains into the sea,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And still the sea is salt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It's basically three iterations of the same image/idea.You don't learn anything new from the last two lines that you didn't already learn from the first four. But the poem still works because it's not trying to move you anywhere; rather, it works by &lt;b&gt;accumulation&lt;/b&gt;. By saying the same thing in different ways it convinces you of a truth: that life is unchanging, nothing is lost, nothing is gained.

Anna Semyonovna Prismanova's poem works similarly. It explores her idea of artistic cause and effect from a variety of angles (specifically, lines 2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and 9-10). By demonstrating how many ways there are to express her idea, she convinces us of its truth.

There's so much more to say but, alas, I must go. I'll write a little something tomorrow morning from my exotic Canadian hotel room. Until then!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-jolt-by-anna-semyonovna-prismanova.html" data-text="Reading Anna Semyonovna Prismanova's &amp;quot;The Jolt&amp;quot;" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F08%2Fthe-jolt-by-anna-semyonovna-prismanova.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Unpoetic Things: On Memory and Creativity</title>
  <content type='html'>This morning I decided to walk to work instead of taking the train. It takes twice as long, but it's a beautiful walk along Commonwealth Avenue and through the Public Garden and the Common. There was a man playing &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnWqb93xdlo" target="_blank"&gt;Bach's 'Ave Maria' on a nylon string guitar &lt;/a&gt;on the bridge that crosses the pond in the Public Garden. There was this priest at our church when I was growing up in Clovis. He had a thick beard and a deep voice. He over-pronounced his words and over-projected his voice, which gave his sermons a dramatic effect. He breathed deeply and loudly through his nose. When I was taking karate lessons in the 7th grade there was this master Judo instructor who came to our little dojo and gave a special class on a Saturday morning. He was tall and fat and bald and had this strange yellow patch of skin on one side of his face. His gi fell open at one point and his heavy, jumbo globe of a belly was the dojo's center of gravity. I remember thinking that he was so gross. And I knew another bald man who had a place in the country with his wife and daughters, and they had two or three horses on a couple acres of grassy land, and I remember walking with him and my father and my brothers in their back yard and the bald man was wearing a bucket hat and one of his horses came up to him and he stroked its face and talked to it quietly.

All this is to say that I wrote a poem this morning. The poem I wrote was made out of these memories, and several others.

&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Boston_Public_Garden_Suspbridge.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Boston_Public_Garden_Suspbridge.jpg" height="459" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

How do these unpoetic things become a poem, and why? What pot of chemicals boiled over in my brain and made me write? How did these memories get from one side of the bridge to the other — from my mind to the written word? Why these memories and not some other ones? Why today? Why ever?

I'm learning to believe again that it's not really my place to ask any of these questions. The imagination is its own creature. It lives and breathes and dreams with a will of its own. Here are some lines from Wordsworth's *Prelude*:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...who shall parcel out
His intellect by geometric rules,
Split like a province into round and square?
Who knows the individual hour in which
His habits were first sown, even as a seed?
Who that shall point as with a wand and say
"This portion of the river of my mind
Came from yon fountain?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;This belief is probably why I put so much &lt;b&gt;trust in preference&lt;/b&gt;. I like what I like without apology. By going outside myself toward what I enjoy, I draw closer to the world *and *to myself. Another word for it is &lt;b&gt;intuition&lt;/b&gt;. I love that word, "intuition." Tuition within, an inner teacher. When I'm writing, I'm just taking dictation. I'm just as much an outsider to my poetry as anybody else. That, to me, feels like the healthiest relationship a poet can have to her or his own work. Here's a line from Devin Johnston's "Nothing Song":
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;"It's not myself I sing, or love, or anything that has a source. I dreamed these words while  riding on my horse."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <title type='text'>'Fresno County Library' by Michelle Patton</title>
  <content type='html'>Today I'm reading 'Fresno County Library' by Michelle Patton, from issue no. 100 of  *&lt;a href="http://www.zyzzyva.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Zyzzyva&lt;/a&gt;*. I'm from the Central Valley and spent most of my life in Fresno, so this poem was special to me. But I think I would have enjoyed and noticed this poem even without that connection. It's got a sense of humor, it respects the integrity of the sentence, and it balances a lyric voice with an implied narrative.

Enough prologue, though. Here's 'Fresno County Library':
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;It's always the same: the eternal scrape
of chairs against linoleum, the Librarians
never losing their minds, the children's section
with its bright animals and solar systems.
You'd like to be like your father, a galaxy
of facts flickering behind your forehead,
but you've always got late fees and never
finish anything, wandering the aisles
in your too-big shoes and your too-big sweater,
checking the catalog, designing elaborate
reading plans, only to give up after the preface,
go outside to smoke and stare at the homeless guy
who unrolls his sleeping bag under a dusky sky
that could make you ache if you stared
long enough, if you thought long enough about why
he unrolls his bag every evening, then paces
between two old trees, you might wonder
what the trees know, or where his mother could be.
Oh everything passes, even this sky.
You'll go back in with the many photographs
of authors smiling from dusty book jackets,
the old man who reads quietly to the statues,
and the woman carefully copying every word
from a book about Venice. You'll drink
the benevolent water and smile at the janitor
who pushes in chairs and wears a long-suffering
kindness on his face, as if we were his
special wards, we the readers and wanderers,
the hungry and the lost.

— Michelle Patton, *&lt;a href="http://www.zyzzyva.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Zyzzyva&lt;/a&gt;*, no. 100, Spring/Summer 2014, pp.39-40&lt;/blockquote&gt;Notice all the layers of night sky in this poem: there's the solar system in the children's section, the galaxy in the speaker's father's forehead, and the dusky sky under which the homeless man is preparing his bed. Each is associated with a different kind of knowledge. The children's section is a nurturing kind of learning that comes through instruction; the father's mind is a storehouse of facts and experiences gathered throughout a life; and the homeless man is something else, perhaps a spiritual knowledge beyond books, perhaps a form of madness. (His pacing between two trees feels like reading to me, the tracing of the eye across a page from left to right, left to right. The pages of a book are often called leaves.)

It's a very realistic look at what libraries provide: they're just as much a social sanctuary — a last resort for the desperate — as they are a source of knowledge. Communities of knowledge can serve as clean, well-lighted places to go when we have nowhere else. Readers are "wanderers," "hungry," "lost." Notice the punning hint toward *The Odyssey* in that phrase from the eighth line: "wandering the aisles." And yet I don't think this poem is cheer-leading for libraries and books. It's too complicated and ambivalent for that. It seems to be almost skeptical about reading and knowledge, especially with the image of "the woman carefully copying every word / from a book about Venice." There's a kind of madness to that copying, a bent relationship to words and the world.

What a great poem, right? There's more poetry to read in *&lt;a href="http://www.zyzzyva.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Zyzzyva&lt;/a&gt; *no. 100, plus a lot of great fiction and non-fiction. Besides this by Michelle Patton, I was really only crazy about one other poem in the collection, so I'll read that one tomorrow. Until then!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/fresno-county-library-by-michelle-patton.html" data-text="'Fresno County Library' - a #poem by Michelle Patton in @zyzzyvamag" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F08%2Ffresno-county-library-by-michelle-patton.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Dream Song 1' by John Berryman</title>
  <content type='html'>I'm going to wrap up my look into the latest issue of  *&lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;Salmagundi&lt;/a&gt;* by looking at Henri Cole's essay on John Berryman's *The Dream Songs*. The first and only time I opened *The Dream Songs* I was very put off. I didn't know what to make of them. I wish I'd known then that that was the point. Here's Cole:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;[Berryman] spent thirteen years writing *The Dream Songs* and in them rejects the decorous Anglophilia and formal versification that were fashionable during the decade before. "I set up *The Dream Songs* as hostile to every visible tendency in both American and English poetry," Berryman said. Instead we get a new kind of diction—ridiculous, grotesque, horrible, delicious—that better suits the generally extravagant situations in which the sobbing protagonist Henry finds himself.

 —Henri Cole, *&lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;Salmagundi&lt;/a&gt;*, Nos. 182-183, ©2014,&amp;nbsp; p.56&lt;/blockquote&gt;I don't know that this knowledge would have made a difference to me then. When I was younger I most appreciated a commitment to formal beauty. Shakespeare and Spencer were my jam, the sonnets especially. I liked the sense of mastery, of craft. But I also liked Whitman's *Leaves of Grass* and Thoreau's *Walden*. I liked their abundance, the element of chance that seemed to be at work in their composition. Perhaps if my appreciation for this American voice had been stronger, if I had felt less ashamed of liking it, I would have been more ready for Berryman's *The Dream Songs*.

(But we're ready for different pieces of art at different times in our lives. Saying "I wish I understood that artist" or "I wish I could hear what's so great in that musician" is like saying "I wish I could be a grown up *now*." It's a perfectly healthy thing to think and say, but it's perfectly useless, too.)

&amp;nbsp;Enough about me, though. Here's the first of Berryman's *The Dream Songs*:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Huffy Henry hid&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the day,
unappeasable Henry sulked.
I see his point,—a trying to put things over.
It was the thought that they thought
they could *do* it made Henry wicked &amp;amp; away.
But he should have come out and talked.

All the world like a woolen lover
once did seem on Henry’s side.
Then came a departure.
Thereafter nothing fell out as it might or ought.
I don’t see how Henry, pried
open for all the world to see, survived.

What he has now to say is a long
wonder the world can bear &amp;amp; be.
Once in a sycamore I was glad
all at the top, and I sang.
Hard on the land wears the strong sea
and empty grows every bed.

—&lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/dream-song-1" target="_blank"&gt;text from poets.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I won't say "What more is there to say?" because clearly this poem is so complex. I will recommend that if this poem hasn't convinced you to read *The Dream Songs*, then go find and read the rest of Henri Cole's essay in *&lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;Salmagundi&lt;/a&gt;. *It'll do the trick. (Oh, and Cole lists what he thinks are the best of *The Dream Songs*: nos. 1, 4, 5, 14, 21, 26, 29, 37, 45, 46, 53, 76, and 77. Go find 'em!)

Alright, friendlings, I've gotta be gone, like, ten minutes ago. Until tomorrow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/dream-song-1-by-john-berryman.html" data-text="Reading John Berryman's Dream Songs with Henri Cole" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F08%2Fdream-song-1-by-john-berryman.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Weekly Wrap-Up (August 17-23, 2014)</title>
  <content type='html'>This has been a fun and very busy week. I'm adjusting to balancing this blog with my job, my duties at &lt;a href="http://oxandpigeon.com/" target="blank"&gt;Ox and Pigeon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.strangeletjournal.com/" target="blank"&gt;Strangelet&lt;/a&gt;, and my new work at &lt;a href="http://www.asymptotejournal.com/"&gt;Asymptote&lt;/a&gt;. It's doable, for sure, but I've got to *learn *to do it.

I took a couple days to read 'Blossom' by April Bernard (&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/blossom-by-april-bernard.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/a-quick-note-and-then-more-on-april.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), read a cool &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/intermission-by-joan-hutton-landis.html" target="_blank"&gt;sort of narrative poem by Joan Hutton Landis&lt;/a&gt;, enjoyed a little &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/beads-by-olga-sedakova.html" target="_blank"&gt;translated poetry by Olga Sedakova&lt;/a&gt;, and finished off the week with a &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/georgia-okeefe-by-campbell-mcgrath.html" target="_blank"&gt;prose-poem by Campbell McGrath&lt;/a&gt;.

The blog will be two months old tomorrow. It's had just over two thousand page hits already, which I think is a great start. But it's not about those numbers, of course. If I'd started a site looking at diet pills or video games, I'd have many times more page hits. What matters to me is that I've been able to think and write about &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html" target="_blank"&gt;the work of twenty-eight poets &lt;/a&gt;whom, until I'd started this blog, I knew little or nothing about. Just for me, it's be a great learning experience.

So there are a few things I want to do moving forward.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;More book reviews. Every couple weeks I would like to do a two- or three-part review of a full book of poetry or poetry criticism. Since I have no budget that's going to mean soliciting publishers for ARCs, which is a whole set of tasks in itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More special features. I recently applied for a blogging position at a major website, which required me to list a bunch of feature and series ideas. As I brainstormed and generate ideas it got me thinking, "I should be doing this stuff *anyway*, whether or not it's for a major website." Like I said in an earlier post, I want to detail the ridiculous and impractical costs of subscribing to multiple poetry journals. I want to interview poets on how they work. I want to do features on small publishing houses. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing for other journals and blogs. Just writing for my own site feels unadventurous to me; I want a bigger challenge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;All this will probably mean I'll be going from seven-days-a-week to just weekdays. The stats show that weekend readership is *very low *anyway, so I gather that it won't be much of a loss to all of you. And it will mean fresher, more unique content on the blog, so that's a win for everybody.

OK, I've got to get going, but I'll be back with more poetry tomorrow. Until then! </content>

  <title type='text'>'Georgia O'Keefe' by Campbell McGrath</title>
  <content type='html'>This morning on the train to work I re-read some poetry and essays from the latest issue of *&lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;Salmagundi&lt;/a&gt;*. I wish I'd been a regular *&lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;Salmagundi&lt;/a&gt;* reader for longer. I once raided a big stack of books that Geoffrey Hartman was giving away and pulled out two issues of *&lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;Salmagundi&lt;/a&gt;*; I should have taken it as a hint that this is one of &lt;b&gt;*the *&lt;/b&gt;journals to be reading. But like most people, I need to be beaten over the head with a thing before I'll notice it. So this is me beating you over the head: go buy a copy of *&lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;Salmagundi&lt;/a&gt;.*

Today I'm reading the prose poem 'Georgia O'Keefe' by Campbell McGrath. &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/aurora-perpetua-by-campbell-mcgrath.html" target="_blank"&gt;I've featured a poem of McGrath's before here on the blog&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first prose poem I've looked at, so here goes:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Grey is the color of blindness, but also of sight: white rocks and black rocks, the moon and her daughter, equally grey. The door into the dark is the door into the light, neither can exist without its opposite, women and men, the living and the dead, we belong to their long marriage quarrel, everything grey in the cloud-forest of the mind. Grey of milk in a shadowed pitcher, grey of goslings, grey of rivets. Grey being the color of eternity I commend myself to its embrace, grey potato-skins slopped for mud-grey hogs, the dead piglet consumed by its kin, old snow in the coal-ash arroyo, almond and violet gravel, grey as affirmation, grey as union, the doe at twilight, the mesa by moonlight, cloud-drawn dawn like a brindled flank. Color of Third Avenue mornings flush with fresh linen, roman numerals in basalt, the Chrysler building an awl to pierce the sheep’s caul through which an airplane descends with bursts of illumination befitting the immodesty of 20th Century gods. Grey as the void of memory in which I imagine the feel of a brush in hand but can’t recall its purpose, can’t envision the cream of jimson weed, the slashed throat of a dahlia—what else did god intend us to paint beyond the flowers he saw fit to bequeath us, rocks and flowers, say. Bones as a last resort. Color of ghosts, color of clouds and Manhattan, of everything Steiglitz ever touched or photographed, my body unrecognizable as the city’s erotic stone-work—who is that woman with hips like the weathered horns of an antelope skull? Where has it run to, in this desert, the lavish water of her hair?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8212; &lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/upload/poems-online.pdf"&gt;Text from the *Salmagundi* website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;How do you begin to talk about a prose poem? There are no formal divisions you can use to say "Look at this part" and "Look at that part." Everything comes out in a rush, even if you read it slowly. If there is a movement it is in the type of images. We move from abstraction and nature imagery (common nouns) to specific people and places (proper nouns). It moves from definitions (grey is this; grey is that) to a question ("who is that woman?") the only answer to which can be: Georgia O'Keefe. And how beautiful is that last question: "Where has it run to, in this desert, the lavish water of her hair?" It might as well ask &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballade_des_dames_du_temps_jadis" target="_blank"&gt;"*Mais où sont les neiges d'antan?*"&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cRjWijZX-R4/U_c4TsQnwjI/AAAAAAAAAhA/Etd7o1XpewM/s1600/okeefe.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cRjWijZX-R4/U_c4TsQnwjI/AAAAAAAAAhA/Etd7o1XpewM/s1600/okeefe.jpg" height="320" width="267" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 I don't usually associate Georgia O'Keefe with the color grey. From experiences of her &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=georgia+o%27keeffe&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=eHV&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;channel=sb&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=Yjr3U9evLsWZyATG0YGoCw&amp;amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ#channel=sb&amp;amp;q=georgia%20o%27keeffe%20cityscapes&amp;amp;revid=140012382&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;imgdii=_" target="_blank"&gt;cityscapes and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=georgia+o%27keeffe&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=eHV&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;channel=sb&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=Yjr3U9evLsWZyATG0YGoCw&amp;amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ#channel=sb&amp;amp;q=georgia%20o%27keeffe%20landscapes&amp;amp;revid=1143156862&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;imgdii=_" target="_blank"&gt;landscapes&lt;/a&gt;, I expect bold colors. Bold colors are a sort of loud renunciation of grey. A boldly colored painting says, "No! Not grey!" Doesn't this mean, though, that the artist is fixated on grey, just as the immaculate saint is fixated on sin? Now that I'm thinking about it, though, I can't help but concentrate on the grey spaces in her work. Look what you've done, McGrath!

There's a little passage in there that's a mash-up of two Gerard Manley Hopkins poems. "cloud-drawn dawn like a brindled flank" comes from &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/122/12.html" target="_blank"&gt;'The Windhover"&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon&lt;/blockquote&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/122/13.html" target="_blank"&gt;"Pied Beauty"&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I don't really know what McGrath is doing here with this play on Hopkins. I know it's fun to play with these things, as a poet, but what's he trying to say by playing with Hopkins in a poem about Georgia O'Keefe? I don't really know enough about Hopkins to comment, or O'Keefe for that matter, or whether there was some connection between his poetry and her painting, but it's a mystery I wouldn't mind getting to the bottom of.

Alright, I must be going now, to quote the bear. Have a good day all! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/georgia-okeefe-by-campbell-mcgrath.html" data-text="Reading 'Georgia O'Keefe' by Campbell McGrath in @SalmagundiMag" data-via="timothyjellison" data-related="salmagundimag"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F08%2Fgeorgia-okeefe-by-campbell-mcgrath.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Beads' by Olga Sedakova</title>
  <content type='html'>Happy Translation Thursday! Today I'm looking at 'Beads' by Olga Sedakova (translated by Stephanie Sandler) in the *&lt;a href="http://www.nereview.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New England Review&lt;/a&gt;* &lt;a href="http://www.nereview.com/back-issues/vol-34-2013-2014/volume-34-no-3-4-2014/" target="_blank"&gt;double issue&lt;/a&gt; that came out this spring. If you like Russian literature you really should &lt;a href="http://www.nereview.com/subscribe/" target="_blank"&gt;pick this one up&lt;/a&gt;. It features classic writers like Pushkin, Chekhov, and Dostoevsky alongside newer voices like Mikhail Shishkin, Olga Slavnikova, Anzhelina Polonskaya, and Lev Rubinstein.

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CorX_LMjhJg/U_XmmdCQe0I/AAAAAAAAAgw/dEITis5Vkpg/s1600/olgasedakova.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CorX_LMjhJg/U_XmmdCQe0I/AAAAAAAAAgw/dEITis5Vkpg/s1600/olgasedakova.jpg" height="320" width="213" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There's a new book of Olga Sedakova translations &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/In-Praise-Poetry-Olga-Sedakova/dp/1940953022" target="_blank"&gt;coming out this December&lt;/a&gt;, and there's another &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elegies-Bucknell-Series-Contemporary-Poetry/dp/0838755585" target="_blank"&gt;collection of poetry already available&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Believe-Letters-Olga-Sedakova/dp/1611482925" target="_blank"&gt;a collection of her essays&lt;/a&gt;. You can also read many free samples of her work &lt;a href="http://www.olgasedakova.com/eng/" target="_blank"&gt;on her website&lt;/a&gt;.

A quick word about translation. Translations expose you to how much you don't know about the world. This can be a source of great frustration, but it can also be an invitation: an invitation to know more, to experience more, to be more. But yes, *frustration*. Having grown up in the U.S., when I read an American writer, I can quickly get a sense of their politics, their religion, their place. I can imagine them in an historical context; I can see how they play with and to their context. When I read a writer from another country, I have very little context, and what little context I have is probably skewed toward an Americentric point of view. This high level of unfamiliarity makes me tend to embrace poems that are universal (seeming), that don't deal with particulars of place, history, or context. I would love to read a poem that details intimate knowledge of Fresno or Boston or New York or London or Paris because I've spent a lot of time in those cities. But Moscow? Nairobi? Lima? Tokyo? I hardly know anything about them, so when I encounter poems about them *&lt;b&gt;I can choose either to learn or to move on&lt;/b&gt;*.&amp;nbsp; Which would you choose?

Alright, enough pondering. Here's 'Beads' by Olga Sedakova:
&lt;blockquote&gt;My grandmother's lapis ring,
my great grandfather's books—these
I can give up, I think.
But somehow these glass beads
are more than I can bear to lose.

They are bright-colored, simple
&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Glass-beads.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Glass-beads.jpg" height="150" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;like a garden of peacocks, and
their heart is made of stars and fish scales.

Or a lake, and fish in the lake:
first a black one dives up, then scarlet,
then the tiniest fish, a flash of green—
he will never come back now,
indeed, why should he?

I love not the poor, nor the rich,
not this country, nor any other,
not the time of day, nor time of year—
but I do love what is all seeming:
it is a mysterious form of joy.
It has no price and makes no sense.

— Olga Sedakova, trans. Stephanie Sandler, *&lt;a href="http://www.nereview.com/" target="_blank"&gt;New England Review&lt;/a&gt;*, Vol. 34, Number 3-4, ©2014,&amp;nbsp; p.244&lt;/blockquote&gt;Those first three lines are quite a gesture. The writer raises a certain set of expectations, and then sweeps them aside. Nine out of ten poems that begin "My grandmother's lapis ring, / my great grandfather's books" are about to talk *about those things*. Heirlooms seem to have, for all of us, an inherent sense of value. But the speaker says, "No. That's not where value is. Value is in reverie, in beauty free of context, in 'what is all seeming'."

Does Sedakova agree? I mean really, does Sedakova actually *believe *what the speaker of the poem is saying? Or is she being ironic, and the poem is actually a critique of aestheticism's ethical impotency? "I love not the poor, nor the rich, / not this country, nor any other, / not the time of day, nor time of year" is a pretty serious thing to say. I think a lot of people would object to that way of looking at the world; many others might praise it. Where do you fall?

It's an open question. Our answers might tell us a lot about who we are. This universal (seeming) poetry — the poetry that doesn't dig into the particulars of place and history — can take us into foreign parts of ourselves. There are things we think that we don't know we think until someone else shows us how to voice them. It's a form of travel. It can be fun or it can be frustrating, and in the times of frustration with myself I can choose either to learn or to move on. Which would you choose? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/beads-by-olga-sedakova.html" data-text="Reading 'Beads' by Olga Sedakova" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F08%2Fbeads-by-olga-sedakova.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=true&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>A quick note, and then more on April Bernard</title>
  <content type='html'>I want to continue looking at 'Blossom' by April Bernard, but first I need to say  something about &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/blossom-by-april-bernard.html" target="_blank"&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt;. It's a sort of correction, or explanation of a correction. I had originally written the following  opening paragraph in yesterday's post:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Today I want to look at a poem by &lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/april-bernard" target="_blank"&gt;April Bernard&lt;/a&gt; from the Spring/Summer 2014 issue of &lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;*Salmagundi*&lt;/a&gt;. Ms. Bernard is the author of several poetry collections — including *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Psalms-Poems-April-Bernard/dp/0393313042" target="_blank"&gt;Psalms&lt;/a&gt;*, *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Swan-Electric-Poems-April-Bernard/dp/0393325083" target="_blank"&gt;Swan Electric&lt;/a&gt;*, and *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Romanticism-Poems-April-Bernard/dp/0393338894" target="_blank"&gt;Romanticism&lt;/a&gt;* — as well as a novel, *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Miss-Fuller-Novel-April-Bernard/dp/1586421956" target="_blank"&gt;Miss Fuller&lt;/a&gt;*.&lt;/blockquote&gt;But then my wife, Amy, wrote me a quick email:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Can you edit it so that  it doesn't say "Ms. Bernard" in the second sentence? You've never said  Mr. so-and-so when referring to a male poet. Why not just say Bernard?&lt;/blockquote&gt;She was absolutely right. In the drafting phase, my first sentence had ended with "April Bernard", so I changed my second sentence opener from "April Bernard" to "Ms. Bernard" just to avoid the repetition. But saying "Ms. Bernard" comes off as condescending. It's like calling her an authoress or a poetess. This is something Amy and I talk about a lot and take very seriously. In  academic circles, where people should know better, it's  very common to refer to male academics by their last name (citing them  as an abstract source of authority) but female academics by their first name (citing them  as a friend). What's in a name? A lot.

The literary world is heavily gendered. Look at &lt;a href="http://www.vidaweb.org/the-count-2012/" target="_blank"&gt;the VIDA count&lt;/a&gt;. Read &lt;a href="http://www.bustle.com/articles/27107-jennifer-weiner-on-women-in-publishing-there-is-a-real-quantifiable-inequity" target="_blank"&gt;Jennifer Weiner&lt;/a&gt;'s interview on *Bustle*. Check out &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/07/coverflip-maureen-johnson_n_3231935.html#slide=2421752" target="_blank"&gt;this feature on book covers&lt;/a&gt; and tell me it isn't 100% true. I do what little I can to help alleviate the problem. One of my standards as a critic is to spend just as much time covering literature by women as I do literature by men. I look forward to the day when I'm making decisions at a major magazine or press and can help on a larger scale. But I slipped up yesterday, and to anyone who may have been offended, I apologize.

----

Returning to 'Blossom' by April Bernard, which appears in the Spring/Summer 2014 issue of &lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;*Salmagundi*&lt;/a&gt;. Let's look at it stanza by stanza. First we have three beautiful, warm images.
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;White, smudged like pastel on paper, like the orchard
May-blurred on the hillside
White like the light in the door as it opens&lt;/blockquote&gt;Then we move to something still white, but differently toned, touched with a note of death:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;White as the robes of T’ang mourners in the scroll
where the landscape slides into script,
vertical calendar of a dead man’s life

White as the page these lines sit upon
puckering the rice paper with brush-strokes
that this side, the side that is life, has drawn&lt;/blockquote&gt;By this point we've established a motion. Three lines at a time, each stanza beginning with "White". There's a rhythm to it that allows us to concentrate. The rhythm draws us into the poem so that this next stanza can gently shake us:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Gone into light he is now everywhere light is
I see and reach
but my hands are thick with shadow&lt;/blockquote&gt;Look at that first line again, "Gone into light he is now everywhere light is". The grammar breaks in half. It's a sob. Or rather, it's a stifled sob. What would it take to make this line grammatical? "Gone into light, he is now everywhere light is". That comma, now missing, is the pause the speaker can't allow herself. That pause is an absence. Absence is too painful. The poem enacts the fragility of its own utterance. (Did I lose you? Stay with me.)
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;He left in spring light
He threw blessings like stars of shattered blossoms
on our sleeves and hair&lt;/blockquote&gt;These three lines convince me that I *have *to read more of April Bernard. The string of realistic images is shattered, but it's so beautiful that I just don't care. And the poet senses that she's crossed a threshold, that she's reached an imaginative peak, so she breaks the three-line stanza pattern:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;It is not that I would drag him back —&lt;/blockquote&gt;Self-consciousness. The writer knows that she is writing. The speaker knows that she is speaking. And she wonders, "To whom?" and "To what end?" Could we have known until now that this poem was a prayer, a psalm? (If you haven't studied psalm form, read &lt;span class="a-size-medium"&gt;Walter Brueggemann&lt;/span&gt;'s amazing book *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Message-Psalms-Augsburg-Testament-Studies/dp/0806621206" target="_blank"&gt;The Message of the Psalms&lt;/a&gt;*.) She seems to be saying "I'm not &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus#Death_of_Eurydice" target="_blank"&gt;Orpheus&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not so unrealistic that I think my art can bring back the dead." But the heaviness of that pause, "—", makes it feel like she has *to convince herself *that this *really *isn't what she wants. So what does she want?
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I ask instead that the scent of light carry forward
this moment and the next
that the brush meet the paper not as blot but as sign

So what was formerly shadow may become a whiteness
White in the light of the door as it opens, blossom
of light perpetual in all places we yet go&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I can't add anything to that. Anything I'd try to add would be inadequate. This poem amazes me with its perfect marriage of intelligence and feeling. Read the poem again &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/blossom-by-april-bernard.html" target="_blank"&gt;without all the scaffolding&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for reading, friends. Keep doing your part to support poetry. Buy &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/April-Bernard/e/B001HOJBU8/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1408539438&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"&gt;April Bernard's books&lt;/a&gt;. Buy a copy of &lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;*Salmagundi*&lt;/a&gt;. Find your favorite poet's address and write her or him a fan letter. But most of all, keep reading and writing and talking about poetry. Until tomorrow, all.

  <title type='text'>'Blossom' by April Bernard</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/sites/default/files/styles/286x289/public/images/biographies/AprilBernard_NewBioImage.png?itok=mTchCCa9" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://www.poets.org/sites/default/files/styles/286x289/public/images/biographies/AprilBernard_NewBioImage.png?itok=mTchCCa9" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today I want to look at a poem by &lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/april-bernard" target="_blank"&gt;April Bernard&lt;/a&gt; from the Spring/Summer 2014 issue of &lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;*Salmagundi*&lt;/a&gt;. Bernard is the author of several poetry collections — including *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Psalms-Poems-April-Bernard/dp/0393313042" target="_blank"&gt;Psalms&lt;/a&gt;*, *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Swan-Electric-Poems-April-Bernard/dp/0393325083" target="_blank"&gt;Swan Electric&lt;/a&gt;*, and *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Romanticism-Poems-April-Bernard/dp/0393338894" target="_blank"&gt;Romanticism&lt;/a&gt;* — as well as a novel, *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Miss-Fuller-Novel-April-Bernard/dp/1586421956" target="_blank"&gt;Miss Fuller&lt;/a&gt;*.

There are several reasons I write this blog. It helps me start each day on a positive and thoughtful note. It helps me get some writing exercise in before a long day of dealing with words that aren't mine, some of them exciting, most of the not. But one of the key reasons I write the blog is that *&lt;b&gt;it keeps me open to discovery&lt;/b&gt;*. It's so easy to just say, "I've got my Auden and my Yeats and my Olds and my Dickinson. That's all the poetry I need." But by forcing myself to look outward, to look at what's new in the world, I'm constantly at the ready to receive whatever good life has to offer.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those "I &lt;u&gt;love&lt;/u&gt; *EVERYTHING!*" people. For every poem and poet I feature here there are ten or twenty I've passed by without comment. Some I passionately dislike, some I really don't care either way. But when I do like something, I know it. It's this splash of cold water in the face. It's someone pulling your hair. Sometimes it's a one-off thing: yesterday I read a poem by Joan Hutton Landis but I don't think I'll go out actively seeking the rest of her work. And then other times it's deeper, more of a connection. It's how I've felt about &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/devin-johnston" target="_blank"&gt;Devin Johnston&lt;/a&gt;'s poetry, which I discovered while writing on the blog. Two days ago I didn't even know the name April Bernard and now I'll be looking for it on every shelf for the rest of my life. That's discovery.

I'll have to talk more about this poem tomorrow (&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/a-quick-note-and-then-more-on-april.html" target="_blank"&gt;EDIT: Here's the followup post&lt;/a&gt;). Here's 'Blossom', by April Bernard:

&lt;blockquote&gt;White, smudged like pastel on paper, like the orchard
May-blurred on the hillside
White like the light in the door as it opens

White as the robes of T’ang mourners in the scroll
where the landscape slides into script,
vertical calendar of a dead man’s life

White as the page these lines sit upon
puckering the rice paper with brush-strokes
that this side, the side that is life, has drawn

Gone into light he is now everywhere light is
I see and reach
but my hands are thick with shadow

He left in spring light
He threw blessings like stars of shattered blossoms
on our sleeves and hair

It is not that I would drag him back —

I ask instead that the scent of light carry forward
this moment and the next
that the brush meet the paper not as blot but as sign

So what was formerly shadow may become a whiteness
White in the light of the door as it opens, blossom
of light perpetual in all places we yet go&lt;/blockquote&gt;You can find this and more poems on the &lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;*Salmagundi*&lt;/a&gt; website. Do yourself and your literature-loving friends a favor and buy a copy of &lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;*Salmagundi*&lt;/a&gt; online or at your local bookstore. Get &lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/subscriptions.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;a subscription&lt;/a&gt; and save a few bucks. I'm gonna write a post sometime in the next couple months listing the journals and magazines I recommend subscribing to, and &lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;*Salmagundi*&lt;/a&gt; is definitely going to be on it.

Alright, friends. Un abrazo. Until tomorrow. (&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/a-quick-note-and-then-more-on-april.html" target="_blank"&gt;Read part 2...&lt;/a&gt;)

  <title type='text'>'Intermission' by Joan Hutton Landis</title>
  <content type='html'>Today I want to look at 'Intermission' by &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/joan-hutton-landis" target="_blank"&gt;Joan Hutton Landis&lt;/a&gt;, from the Spring/Summer 2014 issue of &lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;*Salmagundi*&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;*Salmagundi*&lt;/a&gt; is a bit more academic than some of the other journals / magazines I've looked at. There's a really interesting and *thorough *essay by &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Adam-Phillips/e/B000APS52U" target="_blank"&gt;Adam Philips&lt;/a&gt; about Freudian psychoanalysis and poetry. There's a fantastic intro to John Berryman's *Dream Songs *by &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Henri-Cole/e/B001IXMPUQ/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1408364333&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"&gt;Henri Cole&lt;/a&gt;. And there's a special feature on &lt;a href="http://www.nybooks.com/books/authors/patrick-leigh-fermor/" target="_blank"&gt;Patrick Leigh Fermor&lt;/a&gt;, whose travel writings have been getting a lot of attention lately. I highly recommend you read &lt;a href="http://ruthfranklin.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Ruth Franklin&lt;/a&gt;'s tribute to the late &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kauffmann" target="_blank"&gt;Stanley Kauffmann&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0966917758/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0966917758&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=6KG3CSU4XOLCEMPF" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=0966917758&amp;amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20" height="320" width="212" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Back to poetry. Joan Hutton Landis is the author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/That-Blue-Repair-Hutton-Landis/dp/0966917758" target="_blank"&gt;*That Blue Repair*&lt;/a&gt;, published by &lt;a href="http://penstrokepress.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Penstroke Press&lt;/a&gt;. She has three poems in this issue of Salmagundi, and I have to confess that I wasn't crazy about the first two. No wait, sorry: there are four poems! That's right. I enjoyed the first poem entitled: 'First Poem'. She takes one of her childhood poems and puts it in a frame of new poetry. So it was the second and third of four poems that I wasn't crazy about. Those two were in a completely different mode than the first poem. They're very learned, very playful with language, but almost to the point of indulgence. She writes "Chests hold glistering coins." Why "glistering"? Who is adding that Middle-English twist when talking about Arabian treasures? Who is it pouring out all this learning throughout the poems? Who is reading *The Golden Bough*, traveling in Beirut, speaking eloquently of Wahabi aesthetics and Glenn Gould?

The sense that there wasn't a character, or a least *there wasn't a character I liked*, turned me sour on those two poems. That's probably unfair. I bet people who like Maryanne Moore will really enjoy those two poems. I don't really get Maryanne Moore.

And then there's this last poem, 'Intermission'.

The speaker has gone alone to a play. He's caught in the crowd of theater-goers as they make their way out of the packed house for some air on 42nd street. The woman in front of him reaches behind her, without looking, and starts tickling his stomach. She turns around and is embarrassed to find that the speaker isn't her husband. She's a newlywed. The speaker plays it cool, says something suave and disarming.

But then we're told it was a memory. It all happened fifty years ago, before he married Myra (who was his "best woman friend" all those years ago and didn't go to the play because she had shingles). Myra's great, the speaker insists. "I still / like her" (awesome use of enjambment!). She's got a fun sense of humor — she uses phrases like "frock incarnadine" and "orotund vacuity" and loves to tell jokes that are absolute groaners. But he's been unable to forget that encounter fifty years ago. There was some kind of transfer of energy in that newlywed's touch. He's cursed because he got to feel her animal affection without any of the sobering roundness that comes with actually *knowing *a person. The question for him is, *Has the persistent memory of that moment corrupted my marriage*? *Why haven't I been able to forget that moment, and what does that say about my relationship to my wife*? He concludes that the "sacred and profane" can exist together, though which was sacred and which profane — the encounter or the marriage — is hard to tell.

It's an interesting question, an interesting look into a psyche. Each character in this little drama is interesting. And then there's the crucial added layer of complexity that Myra, with her groaner jokes and Shakespearean language, reminds me an awful lot of Joan Hutton Landis in those second and third poems that I'd disliked so much. Is Myra a stand-in for Landis? How is Landis using this poem to explore male sexuality from a woman's perspective? Does she buy the speaker's means of recusing himself? Do we?

Go get yourself a copy of &lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;*Salmagundi*&lt;/a&gt;. You'll be glad you did. Tomorrow I'll be looking at a poem by &lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/april-bernard" target="_blank"&gt;April Bernard&lt;/a&gt;. Until then!**  </content>

  <title type='text'>What's coming up this week</title>
  <content type='html'>Hi, all! I've got a crazy busy day ahead of me, so I can't take too much time to write.

This week I'll be looking at a bit more from the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Postmodern-American-Poetry-Anthology-Edition/dp/0393341860" target="_blank"&gt;Postmodern American Poetry &lt;/a&gt;anthology. I'll also be reading from the Spring/Summer 2014 issue of &lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;Salmagundi&lt;/a&gt;. I was just reading &lt;a href="http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/" target="_blank"&gt;Salmagundi&lt;/a&gt; this morning and it's got some great stuff from Henri Cole, April Bernard, Campbell McGrath, and others. Can't wait to share it with you.


Oh, and I've got a book reviewing coming out in the online journal &lt;a href="http://necessaryfiction.com/reviews" target="_blank"&gt;Necessary Fiction &lt;/a&gt;tomorrow! That will be fun. I'll make sure to share a link. I've already published one &lt;a href="http://necessaryfiction.com/reviews/AHandfulofSandbyMarinkoKocectranslatedbyWillFirth" target="_blank"&gt;review of a Croatian novel &lt;/a&gt;on Necessary Fiction.

And the first issue of &lt;a href="http://www.strangeletjournal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Strangelet&lt;/a&gt;, which I help edit, will be coming out this September! It's out at the printer *right now*. That will be fun to see. There's a lot of great sci-fi, fantasy, and speculative fiction in there.

OK, I've gotta stop writing and get back to my other work. Until tomorrow!</content>

  <title type='text'>Weekly Wrap-Up (August 10 - 16, 2014)</title>
  <content type='html'>Wow, this has been a very good and very busy week. This week I spent a couple days reading a poem by Robert Duncan (&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/often-i-am-permitted-to-return-to.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/looking-further-into-robert-duncan.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), gave a quick look into Rebecca Lindenberg's book &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/love-index-by-rebecca-lindenberg.html" target="_blank"&gt;*Love, An Index*&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed a new &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/untitled-poem-by-michael-ondaatje.html" target="_blank"&gt;untitled poem by Michael Ondaatje&lt;/a&gt;, and shared a few thoughts on my recent &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/comic-con-and-paul-muldoon.html" target="_blank"&gt;trip to the Boston Comic Con&lt;/a&gt;. I was also very happy to get some good news: I've been offered and have accepted a position as an Assistant Managing Editor at &lt;a href="http://www.asymptotejournal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Asymptote&lt;/a&gt;, a journal of international literature.

I went out and got myself some new journals this week. I looked at Porter Square Books in Cambridge because I'd heard they have a lot of good stuff, but that was kind of a let down. I'd looked at the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble near Emerson College and that was kind of a bust. Both of them just had the usual stuff you would expect. Lots of copies of *n+1* and *The Paris Review*, and then a handful of trendy zines out of Brooklyn. And since we're in Boston, they had *Agni *and *Ploughshares *and *The Harvard Review*. Those are all &lt;u&gt;great&lt;/u&gt; journals, but what about *The Southern Review*? What about *The Virginia Quarterly*?&amp;nbsp;* *What about *The New England Review*? What about *Salmagundi*? Hell, what about *McSweeney's*?

Then I stopped over to The Harvard Bookstore and there in a little corner of the shop they had exactly what I was looking for. If you're in the Boston area and looking for literary journals, The Harvard Bookstore is the place to go. I picked up a few -- *&lt;b&gt;being well-read is expensive&lt;/b&gt;* -- so I'll look at some poems and essays from those on the blog in the coming weeks.

Alright, I've gotta sign off and get some other work done. I hope everybody's having a good weekend. Until tomorrow, poetry fiends.&amp;nbsp; </content>

  <title type='text'>Looking further into Robert Duncan</title>
  <content type='html'>I can finally share that exciting news! I've accepted a position as an Assistant Managing Editor at &lt;a href="http://www.asymptotejournal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Asymptote&lt;/a&gt;, a journal of international literature. It's a very exciting opportunity. It may mean I'll be adjusting my schedule here on the blog. I might need to find time during my lunch hour to write (as I'm doing today), or I might even start writing and posting in the evenings. In any case, I'll make it work.

&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520234162/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0520234162&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=OJZYBRPZCDFXAOCK" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=0520234162&amp;amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20" height="320" width="194" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yesterday I read Robert Duncan's &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/often-i-am-permitted-to-return-to.html" target="_blank"&gt;'Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow'&lt;/a&gt;, which I first encountered in the Norton Anthology of *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Postmodern-American-Poetry-Anthology-Edition/dp/0393341860" target="_blank"&gt;Postmodern American Poetry&lt;/a&gt;*. It's a complex poem. Something I'd like to keep asking as I investigate this and other poems in the Norton Anthology is: &lt;b&gt;What exactly *is* the postmodern, and what makes *this poem *postmodern?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Most of this poem strikes me as very Modernist, in the style of T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. The allusions in the fourth and fifth stanzas  to "the First Beloved", "the Lady" and the "Queen Under the Hill" especially remind me of Eliot's more religious poems like &lt;a href="http://www.msgr.ca/msgr-7/ash_wednesday_t_s_eliot.htm" target="_blank"&gt;'Ash Wednesday'&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.coldbacon.com/poems/fq.html" target="_blank"&gt;the *Four Quartets*&lt;/a&gt;. There's a really great passage from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Robert-Duncan-The-Ambassador-Venus/dp/0520234162" target="_blank"&gt;Lisa Jarnot's biography of Robert Duncan&lt;/a&gt; that explains &lt;a href="http://www.fascicle.com/issue02/essays/jarnotduncan1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;the complex anthropological and religious allusions&lt;/a&gt; that Duncan is making. Here's Jarnot:

&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Duncan's interest in Celtic myth came partly from the fact that he knew  his biological family, the Duncans, to be of Celtic origin. He used the  game in this poem [*the Celtic game of "ring a round of roses"*] to springboard to two other ideas— that of "the lady"  and that of "the dead." For the Celts, the Queen Under the Hill was  Brigit, for whom fires were burned in worship. As noted in *The Golden Bough*, "like Minerva, Brigit was a goddess of poetry and wisdom...Brigit was the patroness of bards, physicians, and smiths." &amp;nbsp;Secondarily, Duncan saw this Lady as Persephone of Greek myth, the  Queen of the Dead. At this point in the poem, he created a composite  "Lady" of at least three myths– the Celtic Brigit, the Greek Persephone,  and the Christian Mary, (with further manifestation as Eve and Sarah),  and as Duncan pointed out in a lecture in 1959, she was also Morgan Le  Fay of Arthurian legend. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Jarnot makes a very convincing case for Duncan's erudition. But it strikes me that the poem isn't nearly as academic feeling as most of Eliot's poems. One of my favorite Eliot poems is &lt;a href="http://thefirstgates.com/2012/09/07/marina-a-poem-by-t-s-eliot/" target="_blank"&gt;'Marina'&lt;/a&gt; (it's there, just scroll down) because he manages to temper his erudition with musicality and imagery. It's one of the few Eliot poems that doesn't feel anxious or overly professorial. I feel like Duncan does the same thing here.

&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Martin_Schongauer_Madonna_in_Rose_Garden.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Martin_Schongauer_Madonna_in_Rose_Garden.jpg" height="320" width="222" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But even if you explain the allusions, there's still the question of the syntax breaks. You have to stretch your imagination to assemble sentences out of Duncan's phrases. What exactly is happening there? How does that broken or jolting quality relate to the enclosed garden imagery?

And about that enclosed garden, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hortus_conclusus" target="_blank"&gt;the *hortus conclusus*&lt;/a&gt;. Very often the *hortus conclusus *is a symbol of the Virgin Mary, but it is also a symbol of the contemplative life, of peaceful (and therefore threatened) beginnings, and of Eden. Jarnot explains that it is also very likely Machpelah. In Genesis 2:8-9, Abraham is looking for a place to bury his wife Sarah. He approaches the Hittites&amp;nbsp; —
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf&lt;span class="p"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Duncan seems to be activating all of these meanings at once. Permission is granted to return to a place of origin which is also a place of burial. Who gives permission? And what is the form of this returning? Are we talking about memory? About poetry?

This is one of those poems that rewards reflection and investigation. It seems bottomless. I might return to it again, but probably not for a couple of days. I need to expand my sense of the postmodern. Maybe there's another way into this poem that somebody else's poem can show me. Until tomorrow, then. Ciao for now!</content>

  <title type='text'>'Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow' by Robert Duncan</title>
  <content type='html'>I've just started reading through the nearly 1000 pages long Norton Anthology of *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Postmodern-American-Poetry-Anthology-Edition/dp/0393341860" target="_blank"&gt;Postmodern American Poetry&lt;/a&gt;*. 1000 pages seems like a lot, but I can already tell that many of these poets will leave me cold and so won't occupy too much of my time. The first poet featured is Charles Olson, and for the life of me I can't figure out the appeal of Charles Olson. A friend recommended Ben Lerner, who is the last poet featured in the book, and I don't really get Ben Lerner either. I'm hoping this &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/poetry-course-starts-september-6.html" target="_blank"&gt;upcoming course on Modern &amp;amp; Contemporary American Poetry&lt;/a&gt; will help open my mind to these different styles of writing.&amp;nbsp;

But Robert Duncan. I *get* Robert Duncan. I read one of his poems and, even before I understand it, I know that I love it. Not all of the poems, but you don't have to love all of a poet's work. Even the poets I most enjoy I enjoy only half the time, at best.

&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Poet_Robert_Duncan.jpg#mediaviewer/File:Poet_Robert_Duncan.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Poet Robert Duncan.jpg" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e5/Poet_Robert_Duncan.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Poet_Robert_Duncan.jpg#mediaviewer/File:Poet_Robert_Duncan.jpg"&gt;Poet Robert Duncan&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;a class="external autonumber" href="http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/pictures/robert_duncan.jpg" rel="nofollow"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. Licensed under &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Poet_Robert_Duncan.jpg" title="&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Non-free_use_rationale_guideline&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Wikipedia:Non-free use rationale guideline&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Fair use&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of copyrighted material in the context of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Duncan_(poet)&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Robert Duncan (poet)&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Robert Duncan (poet)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;"&gt;Fair use&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.

So here's a poem from the anthology, entitled "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow". I'm going to repeat the title because I think that matters in this case.

&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow&lt;/b&gt;

as if it were a scene made-up by the mind,
that is not mine, but is a made place,

that is mine, it is so near to the heart,
an eternal pasture folded in all thought
so that there is a hall therein

that is a made place, created by light
wherefrom the shadows that are forms fall.

Wherefrom fall all architectures I am
I say are likenesses of the First Beloved
whose flowers are flames lit to the Lady.

She it is Queen Under The Hill
whose hosts are a disturbance of words within words
that is a field folded.

It is only a dream of the grass blowing
east against the source of the sun
in an hour before the sun’s going down

whose secret we see in a children’s game
of ring a round of roses told.

Often I am permitted to return to a meadow
as if it were a given property of the mind
that certain bounds hold against chaos,

that is a place of first permission,
everlasting omen of what is.

— Robert Duncan, *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Postmodern-American-Poetry-Anthology-Edition/dp/0393341860" target="_blank"&gt;Postmodern American Poetry&lt;/a&gt;*, Paul Hoover, editor, ©2013, W.W. Norton and Company, Inc, p.30&lt;/blockquote&gt;Unfortunately, I don't have time to really get into the poem this morning; I'll look more closely at it tomorrow. [&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/looking-further-into-robert-duncan.html" target="_blank"&gt;EDIT: here are my remarks the following day.&lt;/a&gt;] I do have some exciting news to share, too, though I'll have to wait until tomorrow to share it. Until tomorrow, then, friends. Un abrazo.</content>

  <title type='text'>Poetry Course Starts September 6</title>
  <content type='html'>Online learning service Coursera will be offering a &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/modernpoetry" target="_blank"&gt;free course on Modern &amp;amp; Contemporary American Poetry&lt;/a&gt;. Here's the course description from their website:

&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;In this fast-paced course we will read and encounter and discuss a great  range of modern and contemporary U.S. poets working in the  "experimental mode," starting with the 19th-century proto-modernists  Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and ending with 21st-century conceptual  poetics. Aside from providing a perhaps handy or helpful survey and  chronology of 20th- and 21st-century poetry, this course offers a way of  understanding general cultural transitions from modernism to  postmodernism. Some people may wish to enroll as much to gain an  understanding of the modernism/postmodernism problem through a study of  poetry as to gain access to the work of these many poets. Participants  do not need to have any prior knowledge of poetry or poetics. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;The course starts on September 6 &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/modernpoetry" target="_blank"&gt;so join Coursera for free and sign up soon&lt;/a&gt;!

  <title type='text'>Untitled poem by Michael Ondaatje</title>
  <content type='html'>Michael Ondaatje is the author of 13 books of poetry &amp;#8212; though he is probably best known as the author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-English-Patient-Michael-Ondaatje/dp/0679745203" target="_blank"&gt;*The English Patient*&lt;/a&gt;. This untitled poem originally appeared in the Summer 2014 issue of &lt;a href="http://www.threepennyreview.com" target="_blank"&gt;The Threepenny Review&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;blockquote&gt;That poet you scorned&lt;br/&gt;for retiring when he was forty,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;then beginning thirty years later&lt;br/&gt;with the same voice and style&lt;br/&gt;The crack in his life invisible&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What he said in youth&lt;br/&gt;and approaching death&lt;br/&gt;having the same breath&lt;br/&gt;that precise pitch&lt;br/&gt;unaffected by time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What a wonder I think now&lt;br/&gt;after all those wars and eras&lt;br/&gt;of love he must have passed through&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;not one gesture altered&lt;br/&gt;as he wrote, as if he always slept&lt;br/&gt;this way beside her&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What could we learn&lt;br/&gt;by leaving the color blue&lt;br/&gt;for another?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8212; Michael Ondaatje, &lt;a href="http://www.threepennyreview.com/current.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Threepenny Review, Summer 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; It's a short poem with a restrained vocabulary, but Ondaatje manages to fit in a dramatic sense of time passing and a whole cast of characters (the "you" who scorned "that poet", a woman "that poet" slept beside, and the poetic speaker himself).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of us do love to scorn poets and fiction writers for not changing over their careers. We want to see change because we understand change. We understand it so thoroughly that we've convinced ourselves that we like and value change unequivocally. Constancy of subject or style betrays a frightening and enviable depth of experience, a rooted-ness that most of us don't know or understand. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is the "her" in that second-to-last stanza? Is she an allegory for Poetry? Is she the Muse? Or is there some literal woman who inspires him? His wife? A new lover? It could be all of these at the same time, really, but I like the allegorical reading best. Writing poetry is a kind of dreaming while asleep in the arms of one's beloved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That last stanza really sticks out; I'm not really sure I like it. I think the poem would end more gracefully without it; Ondaatje probably knows that but doesn't want the poem to end gracefully. He wants the final question to hit you on the nose. What does it mean to leave a color for someone else? Or does it mean, "leaving the color blue / for another" color, setting blue aside for red or green or yellow? That second interpretation makes more sense to me. It's about constancy. You can keep creating new work through the years by remaining true to one thing. It reminds me of &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/336/291.html"&gt;this stanza by Coventry Patmore&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;blockquote&gt;I vow'd unvarying faith; and she, &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To whom in full I pay that vow, &lt;br/&gt;Rewards me with variety &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Which men who change can never know. &lt;/blockquote&gt; Until tomorrow, all.</content>

  <title type='text'>'Love, An Index' by Rebecca Lindenberg</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;a href="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fws-na.amazon-adsystem.com%2Fwidgets%2Fq%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26ASIN%3D1936365790%26Format%3D_SL250_%26ID%3DAsinImage%26MarketPlace%3DUS%26ServiceVersion%3D20070822%26WS%3D1%26tag%3Dtimreapoe-20&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=1936365790&amp;amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20" height="320" width="232" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ugh. Enough of feeling sorry for myself. There will always be rejection notes. Now is the time for poetry!

I've got a really beautiful hardcover book published by McSweeney's on my desk that I want to recommend. Well actually, I especially want to recommend the title poem: '&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Love-Index-McSweeneys-Poetry-Series/dp/1936365790" target="_blank"&gt;Love, An Index&lt;/a&gt;'.

This is the first I've read from &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/rebecca-lindenberg" target="_blank"&gt;Rebecca Lindenberg&lt;/a&gt;. The title poem is based on this really cool concept. The poem is arranged like the index of a non-fiction book. By reading the index you gather clues about the writer's life and relationships. It's a really interesting idea . Lindenberg's poetry in this book is very visual and conceptual, I think. How words and stanzas are arranged on the page seems more important to Lindenberg than the sound. Though she does have a beautiful sound: quiet and calm and sad. I've put a pic from the first page of 'Love, An Index' below so you can get a sense of her style and how the poem is arranged. I highly recommend it. &amp;nbsp;

  <title type='text'>'A Psalm of Life' by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</title>
  <content type='html'>I've written a few thousand words this morning in an attempt to deal with some recent rejections, but I'm having to face the fact that they won't do any good. They're bitter words; they won't make me feel any better. All this submission and waiting and rejection gets really frustrating.

It's a good way to live — knowing you're working hard toward something you care about. It's much better than the alternative.

But the rejection still sucks.

It's not contemporary poetry, but here are the last three stanzas of 'A Psalm of Life', by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. I've found them comforting in the past. They came to mind now.

&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Lives of great men all remind us
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We can make our lives sublime,
And, departing, leave behind us
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Footprints on the sands of time;

Footprints, that perhaps another,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Seeing, shall take heart again.

Let us, then, be up and doing,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With a heart for any fate;
Still achieving, still pursuing,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Learn to labor and to wait.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Comic Con and Paul Muldoon</title>
  <content type='html'>Yesterday my wife and I went to the Boston Comic Con. I want to share a bit of that experience, but first I want to point out how it ties in to poetry. I've been thinking a lot about &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/18/does-poetry-matter/is-poetry-popular-whos-counting" target="_blank"&gt;this little nugget by Paul Muldoon&lt;/a&gt;. It's pretty short, but the TL;DR is that poetry draws more people in for a more fulfilling experience than pop culture does or can. It's pretty delusional. So delusional, in fact, that it must be an attempt at some kind of ultra-cool ironic gesture. No thanks, Paul.

&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hlyVHyzUjWI/U-jAKOAXjII/AAAAAAAAAek/W95a0oeaxtE/s1600/10603251_10100392211512091_8484454591507557950_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hlyVHyzUjWI/U-jAKOAXjII/AAAAAAAAAek/W95a0oeaxtE/s400/10603251_10100392211512091_8484454591507557950_n.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So Comic Con: It was the first time I've ever been to any kind of Con. I've spent most of my life being very judgmental of conventions and the sort of people who go to them. But it was a really fun time. A *really *fun time. It was like a cross between a county fair and a Halloween party. Everyone there was really pleasant, obviously just happy to be there. There was this palpable good mood throughout the place. There were a lot of families with small kids, a lot of teenagers in groups, a lot of older guys with antisocial beards and ironic tees, fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, and all of them were having a good time. We spoke with some artists and vendors; I got a really fun Star Wars poster by &lt;a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/Justonescarf" target="_blank"&gt;Aaron Wood&lt;/a&gt;. Aaron does these awesome nerd-culture posters in the style of World War II era propaganda posters; &lt;a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/Justonescarf" target="_blank"&gt;you should check them out&lt;/a&gt;.

The biggest thing was that we got to meet James Marsters from *Buffy *(who it turns out is also from Central California!) and Sean Astin. Yes, that's right: Sean Astin. Said hi to Samwise. Shook hands with Rudy. I was a bit star struck. I felt like I handled meeting James Marsters pretty well. I spoke to James Franco a couple times when I was at Yale and felt like I was fairly calm-ish around him. But meeting Sean Astin — I just couldn't find any words.

I guess what I'm trying to get at is that there doesn't have to be this opposition between poetry and pop culture as Paul Muldoon suggests. We can all just like what we like. If the two meet, like &lt;a href="http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/p3cofn/promposals" target="_blank"&gt;when Robert Pinsky read his Promposal poem on the Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt;, then that's awesome. But we'll all be the stronger if we don't create these false oppositions. I'm not saying that as a poetry fan you have to go to Comic Con now; but there are lessons to learn there. Lessons about &lt;b&gt;*community, inclusion, expression, and fun*&lt;/b&gt;. When's the last time you went to a poetry reading that was fun, Paul Muldoon? Maybe the reason poetry sales are so bad (do the math, Paul) is because so much poetry is *just no fun*.</content>

  <title type='text'>Weekly Wrap-Up (August 3 - 9, 2014)</title>
  <content type='html'>It's been a good week. Stressful and good. I accomplished a lot, got a lot of work done at my day job and in my side-projects: editing a couple novels and some short fiction for &lt;a href="http://oxandpigeon.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Ox and Pigeon&lt;/a&gt;, voting on some short stories that had made it through the &lt;a href="http://www.strangeletjournal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Strangelet &lt;/a&gt;slush-pile. I had to turn one of them down. It's tough to say no to a story that's made it that far, but sometimes you have to. To make it out of the slush there's got to be something there, some kind of spark of creativity combined with a sense of craft, but sometimes the balance isn't right and the story just doesn't land. Airplane metaphor: the story takes off just fine but the landing gear is broken. Or it gets up in the air but doesn't go anywhere. Just circles over Phoenix or Atlanta or Milwaukee a few times and then comes right back down in the same place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; But more importantly personally, I've got an interview for an editing internship. I won't reveal any details; I should know more by next Saturday. But it's an amazing opportunity. It would be a big step forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; So this week I did some good reading here in *Tim Reads Poetry*. I looked at &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/a-poem-by-fernando-pessoa.html" target="_blank"&gt;this Fernando Pessoa poem&lt;/a&gt;, and then I &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/more-thoughts-on-pessoa.html" target="_blank"&gt;came back for a second look&lt;/a&gt;. I'm glad I took the time to look at it further; I need to make a habit of spending more time with the poems and poets I enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I got an interesting comment from a reader which &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/cosmopolitanism-local-tradition-and.html" target="_blank"&gt;I responded to&lt;/a&gt; and which led me to read &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-vacation-by-wendell-berry.html" target="_blank"&gt;"The Vacation" by Wendell Berry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I read &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/one-evening-by-william-stafford.html" target="_blank"&gt;"One Evening"&lt;/a&gt;, a poem out of a new collection of William Stafford's poetry, and also &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/homage-by-noelle-kocot.html" target="_blank"&gt;"Homage"&lt;/a&gt;, a poem from Noelle Kocot's 2011 book The Bigger World. And last but not least I read a fun poem called &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/country-music-by-michael-robbins.html" target="blank"&gt;"Country Music"&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Robbins, who very generously tweeted about it and gave the blog a big spike in viewership. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; So this is going to be a busy week. Lots to do on a lot of different fronts. But I'll be writing here every day, of course. Until tomorrow, then.</content>

  <title type='text'>More thoughts on Pessoa</title>
  <content type='html'>Writing a daily blog has its advantages and disadvantages:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;table border="1" cellpadding="5"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;ADVANTAGES&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;DISADVANTAGES&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Habitual writing means&lt;br/&gt;I won't slack off.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mandatory writing means&lt;br/&gt;I can't take a break.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;It's great training in writing.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;My training is embarrassingly&lt;br/&gt;public.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;I'm always moving forward.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I'm always moving forward.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm thinking about that last row especially. I'm always moving on to the next thing, never taking time to come back and reflect. Last night I picked up James Wood's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Fiction-Works-James-Wood/dp/0312428472" target="blank"&gt;*How Fiction Works*&lt;/a&gt; and started reading it through a second time. I had enjoyed it the first time but this time &amp;#8212; wow! &amp;#8212; I'm *really* enjoying it. I don't know what's changed since I read it a year ago, but I'm so much more ready for what Wood has to say now. Something similar happened when I read &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Catcher-Rye-J-D-Salinger/dp/0316769487" target="blank"&gt;*The Catcher in the Rye*&lt;/a&gt; this year. I *hated *the book when I was sixteen but absolutely loved it now that I'm almost thirty. These experiences have got me thinking that I need to make more efforts to revisit works of literature. &lt;b&gt;*Being a reader should be about more than just looking for the next big thing. *&lt;/b&gt;Being a reader should include knowing how to live with the next big thing once it's arrived. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I want to go back and look more closely at yesterday's poem. &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/a-poem-by-fernando-pessoa.html" target="blank"&gt;Yesterday I read a poem by Fernando Pessoa &lt;/a&gt;and finished my post by saying, "What more can you add to that, really?" After thinking about it over the course of the last 24 hours, it turns out there's *a lot *more you can say. Here's the poem again:  &lt;blockquote&gt;To be great, be whole: don't exaggerate
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Or leave out any part of you.
Be complete in each thing. Put all you are
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Into the least of your acts.
So too in each lake, with its lofty life,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The whole moon shines.

—&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Larger-Than-Entire-Universe/dp/0143039555"&gt;*A Little Larger than the Entire Universe*&lt;/a&gt;, Fernando Pessoa, translated by Richard Zenith, Penguin Books, ©2006, p.134&lt;/blockquote&gt; What I neglected to connect was that this message ("Be yourself!") is complicated by the fact that Pessoa is writing under a pseudonym. A man who doesn't even exist is telling us that we shouldn't be afraid to exist! A man hiding behind a persona is telling us not to hide ourselves! Is Pessoa ignorant of this self-contradiction, or is it part of his message? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's assume that it is part of his message &amp;#8212; what then? We could say that it ironically undercuts the poem's stated meaning. Nobody can really "be whole" or "be complete". You can't put "all you are" into your acts because you are irreparably fragmented. It means that Ricardo Reis believes his advice, but Fernando Pessoa doesn't. We should sneer at the advice along with Pessoa; we should kick ourselves a little for finding it so appealing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's one way of looking at it. But another way of reading it is that this poem, and the entire Ricardo Reis persona, is one of Pessoa's ways of being whole. Ricardo Reis has to be invented so that Pessoa doesn't "leave out any part of [himself]." The poet, Pessoa, is the moon, and the poem is the lake in which he shines. There are two things about this that appeal to me. 1) It speaks to my growing notion of poetic *&lt;b&gt;pluralism&lt;/b&gt;*, the idea that one poem just isn't enough. A poet writes more poems like a bird sings new songs: not because she's striving to create the best poem or the poem to end all poems, but because that's just what she does. So a poem in which the poet is whole doesn't have to be this all-inclusive, autobiographical thing, because there will always be more poems in which the poet can reflect more pieces of herself. 2) It appeals to me because it helped me think these words: *&lt;b&gt;a fiction is a lie that carries truth&lt;/b&gt;*. Without the lie of Ricardo Reis, Pessoa couldn't have told this truth. Pessoa needed to break himself apart in order to see what was inside, and in the fragment called Ricardo Reis he found this poem, and in the poem he found himself, and in himself he found.... You see? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a lot more I want to say. About drama. About music. I look forward to saying those things in future posts. I look forward, despite the disadvantages, to moving forward. Until tomorrow, then.</content>

  <title type='text'>A Poem by Fernando Pessoa</title>
  <content type='html'>For today's Translation Thursday read, I had to do a bit of thinking about the title. Nothing about this post's title was easy. First of all, the poem itself has no title, so I chose the ambiguous "A Poem". But more importantly, the author is and is not Fernando Pessoa. Pessoa wrote under several pseudonyms: when this one was published in 1933, readers would have thought it was the creation of Ricardo Reis. Pessoa gave Reis a backstory:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fws-na.amazon-adsystem.com%2Fwidgets%2Fq%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26ASIN%3D0143039555%26Format%3D_SL250_%26ID%3DAsinImage%26MarketPlace%3DUS%26ServiceVersion%3D20070822%26WS%3D1%26tag%3Dtimreapoe-20&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=0143039555&amp;amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ricardo Reis, according to his creator, was born in 1887 in Oporto, which became the focal point of the surviving monarchist forces after the founding of the Portuguese Republic, in 1910. In 1919 the monarchists took control of Oporto but were soon defeated, at which point Reis, a royalist sympathizer (his last name means "kings"), fled to Brazil, where he presumably lived out the rest of his days....

—from Richard Zenith's introduction to &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Larger-Than-Entire-Universe/dp/0143039555"&gt;*A Little Larger than the Entire Universe*&lt;/a&gt;, Fernando Pessoa, Penguin Books, ©2006, p.xxii&lt;/blockquote&gt;If you haven't read him, Pessoa is amazing. Zenith's translation is the one to get; it's published by Penguin Books as &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Larger-Than-Entire-Universe/dp/0143039555"&gt;*A Little Larger than the Entire Universe*&lt;/a&gt;. Here's the poem from February 14, 1933, by Ricardo Reis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To be great, be whole: don't exaggerate
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Or leave out any part of you.
Be complete in each thing. Put all you are
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Into the least of your acts.
So too in each lake, with its lofty life,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The whole moon shines.

  <title type='text'>'One Evening' by William Stafford</title>
  <content type='html'>Today I'm reading 'One Evening' by &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-e-stafford"&gt;William Stafford&lt;/a&gt; (1914-1993), from a new collection called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ask-Me-Essential-William-Stafford/dp/1555976646"&gt;*Ask Me: 100 Essential Poems*&lt;/a&gt;. It's not my favorite book, though I can see why others might really enjoy Stafford's poetry. Hell, I can see how I, if I were in a different mood, might really enjoy Stafford's poetry. His most famous poem, the much-anthologized &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/171495"&gt;"Traveling Through the Dark"&lt;/a&gt;, really is amazing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But I thought William Logan (despite his obsession with poetry as a zero-sum game and his over-writing for comedic effect) nailed it when he said "Stafford possessed a sentimental streak broader than a barn door, and it spoiled a lot of poems" (&lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/247892"&gt;from Logan's review in the July/August 2014 issue of *Poetry Magazine*&lt;/a&gt;). Several of Stafford's nature poems, in my opinion, are marred by the intrusion of an interpreting voice. The poet tries to find meaning in his own observations, rather than letting the reader find the meaning for her- or himself. (This forbearance is one of the things I most admire about &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/search/label/Devin%20Johnston"&gt;Devin Johnston&lt;/a&gt;.) 'One Evening' is, I think, one of the better nature poems, though there are several more that I really enjoyed as well. Here's 'One Evening':
&lt;blockquote&gt;On a frozen pond a mile north of Liberal
almost sixty years ago I skated wild circles
while a strange pale sun went down.

A scattering of dry brown reeds cluttered
the ice at one end of the pond, and a fitful
breeze ghosted little surface eddies of snow.

No house was in sight, no tree, only
the arched wide surface of the earth
holding the pond and me under the sky.

I would go home, confront all my years, the tangled
events to come, and never know more than I did
that evening waving my arms in the lemon-colored light.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8212;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ask-Me-Essential-William-Stafford/dp/1555976646"&gt;*Ask Me: 100 Essential Poems*&lt;/a&gt;, William Stafford, Graywolf Press, © 2014, p. 66&lt;/blockquote&gt;If you're a Wordsworth nut like me, you're probably thinking of &lt;a href="http://mhgaray.wordpress.com/2006/05/07/the-prelude-fragment-william-wordsworth/"&gt;the ice-skating passage in *The Prelude*&lt;/a&gt;. I really enjoy these kinds of poems that recollect a seemingly insignificant moment and try to relate them to the rest of one's life. I especially like it when they buck our expectations; like a good Shakespearean sonnet, the last lines can twist like a knife. There's the ambiguous twist at the end of Robert Frost's &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173536"&gt;'The Road Not Taken'&lt;/a&gt;: "And that has made all the difference." Optimists that we are, we always assume that the difference is a good one, though I think there are signs ("I shall be telling this with a sigh") that it's not so simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stafford does something similar here: I expect him to say in the last stanza that he takes solace from this remembered evening, that he remembers it as a moment of peace before "all my years, the tangled / events to come." But instead he makes an unexpected connection: the poet says "I would... never know more than I did / that evening...." Does this mean that this evening was the height of his knowing, or does it mean that he's always been equally unknowing his entire life? And what kind of knowing are we talking about? What did he know, or not know? And do any of those questions matter compared to the cold, quiet beauty of those first three stanzas? Is there any meaning, anything to know, outside of those images? </content>

  <title type='text'>'The Vacation' by Wendell Berry</title>
  <content type='html'>I mentioned Wendell Berry in &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/08/cosmopolitanism-local-tradition-and.html"&gt;my post earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, so here's a 2012 poem of his that's made available for free &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/245686" target="_blank"&gt;on the Poetry Foundation website&lt;/a&gt;. (If you haven't explored it yet, &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/" target="blank"&gt;poetryfoundation.org&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing resource.) Here's 'The Vacation':
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Once there was a man who filmed his vacation.
He went flying down the river in his boat
with his video camera to his eye, making
a moving picture of the moving river
upon which his sleek boat moved swiftly
toward the end of his vacation. He showed
his vacation to his camera, which pictured it,
preserving it forever: the river, the trees,
the sky, the light, the bow of his rushing boat
behind which he stood with his camera
preserving his vacation even as he was having it
so that after he had had it he would still
have it. It would be there. With a flick
of a switch, there it would be. But he
would not be in it. He would never be in it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'm ambivalent about this idea that a person can be in a place but *not really *be there. We all slip into different modes of being at different times &amp;#8212; daydreaming, sleep, mindless repetition of a menial task, the full wakefulness of physical exertion. Is any one of those modes *more authentic *than the others? Berry would probably say yes; I would say no. Most of the time, I don't really believe in authenticity. It's worth paying attention, though, to the fact that technology takes us into a different mode of being. I'm not judging whether it's good or bad, but it's definitely different. A piece of technology &amp;#8212; whether it's a phone, a camera, a train, or a telescope &amp;#8212; conditions our experiences of places and events. For me, it's a pragmatic decision. What do you *want* out of an experience? Taking photos of a rushing river is a distinct pleasure from paddling down the same river in a kayak. Pick your pleasure, and know it. Or (because this is a pleasure, too) don't.</content>

  <title type='text'>Cosmopolitanism, Local Tradition, and Provincialism</title>
  <content type='html'>Reader &lt;b&gt;BryghtTyger&lt;/b&gt; recently left a comment on my post about &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/math-rock-drummer-by-cameron-dezen.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cameron Dezen Hammon's 'Math Rock Drummer'&lt;/a&gt; regarding the passage highlighted below:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;My approach to literature had its roots in my own conservative  upbringing in California's Central Valley. &lt;mark&gt;I was raised in an  electrically self-conflicted combination of liberal Catholicism and  small-town provincialism&lt;/mark&gt;. As long as I wasn't addressing *that*, that beautiful *tension*, I wasn't going to have a healthy relationship with literature or (more importantly) with other people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;BryghtTyger&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;points out:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;There's  no need for this conflict. Have you ever read any of the poet Wendell  Berry's essays on localism? I also recommend _Slow Food_ by Carlo  Petrini (ISBN: 0231128444). He's far to the Left but still makes a case  for local traditions. &lt;/blockquote&gt;First of all, &lt;b&gt;BryghtTyger &lt;/b&gt;has seen right through me.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;I *love* Wendell Berry. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593760078/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1593760078&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=X5BOH5UK3PUPJQ7D"&gt;The Art of the Commonplace&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorite books, as is &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582437149/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1582437149&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=ETUCAVXK4NCH7SKX"&gt;The Poetry of William Carlos Williams of Rutherford&lt;/a&gt;. And while I haven't read Carlo Petrini, I am a fan of Michael Pollan, Eric Schlosser, and Jonathan Safran Foer's writings on food, something of a slow-foodie, and a recently recommitted vegetarian.

That's not quite the issue, though. &lt;b&gt;BryghtTyger&lt;/b&gt; wants me to know that liberalism and local traditionalism can go hand in hand. They don't need to be in conflict. To that I say: absolutely right, but local traditionalism and provincialism aren't the same thing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have no doubt that Carlo Petrini can be "far to the Left but still [make] a case for local traditions". Of course that combination is possible. There's no reason people in rural, traditional societies can't be every bit as liberal as people in urban, multicultural societies (though, I would argue, it is often much harder to do). Conversely, people in urban, multicultural societies can be every bit as conservative as people in rural, traditional societies. What matters is having an open mind and respecting other ways of life, being able to define oneself and one's culture without shooting down all the others. Cosmopolitanism and respect for local traditions are two sides of the same coin.

But only an outsider &amp;#8212; someone who experiences life from the perspective of exile &amp;#8212; could think about defending local traditions in the plural. A provincial (whether from the country or the town or the city) isn't interested in preserving local traditions generally; he's interested in preserving his own local tradition. To the provincial, everything but his own way seems silly, stupid, maybe even evil. I've met people like this in the country; I've met people like this in small and large towns across the US; I've met people like this in New York and London and Paris; I've found it in myself. So while it's true that this conflict between a universalizing liberal perspective and a narrow local commitment doesn't *need *to happen, the fact is that it does happen. It happens all the time, *hic et ubique*.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's why we need to constantly be re-freshening our perspectives with art and literature and music and (most importantly) good conversation. Notice that I called it a beautiful tension, an electrical combination. I don't think this conflict is a bad thing; it's the only way out of provincialism. For me, acknowledging the tension and engaging with it and being willing to talk about it was a huge step toward becoming more myself and more respectful of other ways of living.</content>

  <title type='text'>'Country Music' by Michael Robbins</title>
  <content type='html'>This morning I'm reading 'Country Music' by &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/michael-robbins"&gt;Michael Robbins&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/07"&gt;the July 7 issue of *The New Yorker*&lt;/a&gt; (scroll all the way to the bottom; the poems are the only items not given an eye-catching graphic). I usually have mixed feelings about the poetry in *The New Yorker*, but I really enjoyed this one by Robbins. Here's 'Country Music':
&lt;blockquote&gt;God bless the midnight bus depot,
the busted guitar case.
God bless diazepam,
its dilatory grace.

God keep Carl Perkins warm
and Jesus Christ erase
my name from all the files in
the county’s database.

The dog that bit my leg
the night I left the state,
Lord won’t you let his
vaccines be up to date.

West Point to the south of me,
Memphis to the north.
In between is planted with
pinwheels for the Fourth.

Smokestack Lightning, Jesus Christ—
whatever your name is—
bless my fingers on these strings,
I’ll make us both famous.

How about that, the new moon,
same as it ever was.
You must’ve been high as a kite
when you created us.

So hurry, hurry, step right up,
there’s something you should see.
The sun shines on the bus depot
like a coat of Creole pink.

God keep the world this clean and bright
and easy to believe in
and let me catch my bus all right,
and then we’ll call it even.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;— &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/07/lifeguard-2"&gt;from The New Yorker website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This poem reminds me a little bit of &lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/howl-parts-i-ii"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn#In_Arkansas:_the_duke_and_the_king"&gt;the duke and the king from *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*&lt;/a&gt;. And there's a bit of a Coen brothers sensibility in there: *Raising Arizona*, *O Brother, Where Art Thou?*, *Inside Llewyn Davis*. Somebody &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/2cbyy5/discussion_the_fall_of_whimsical_and_funny_poetry/"&gt;posted on Reddit &lt;/a&gt;recently that there doesn't seem to be any funny or whimsical poetry anymore, but of course they were basing this on what can be found in &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ocpoetry"&gt;r/ocpoetry&lt;/a&gt;. You really do need to go to the professionals for a good comical poem. Michael Robbins can do it, Kanye can do it, Ogden Nash knew how to do it. And since they're pros, they can use their humor to make serious points. Who hasn't made the bargain: "God keep the world this clean and bright / and easy to believe in / and let me catch my bus all right, / and then we’ll call it even"? It's fun to look down on this &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Chaplin"&gt;Chaplinesque &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramp"&gt;tramp &lt;/a&gt;character, and it's revealing too. But mostly it's fun.

  <title type='text'>'Homage' by Noelle Kocot</title>
  <content type='html'>Today I'm reading 'Homage' by &lt;a href="http://www.wavepoetry.com/products/noelle-kocot"&gt;Noelle Kocot&lt;/a&gt;, from her 2011 book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933517522/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1933517522&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=BNEZMYCYTWF24CPV"&gt;The Bigger World&lt;/a&gt;. This is one I picked at random off the library shelves, and I'm glad I did. All of the poems in this book are written in a sort of fairy-tale style. They are short, somewhat surreal narratives each of which leaves you with *the sense* that some lesson in human nature has been imparted. Here's 'Homage':
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933517522/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1933517522&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=BNEZMYCYTWF24CPV" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=1933517522&amp;amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Rick was a polyamorous shaman,
Who moonlighted as a detective.
He had quite a lot of women
All over the country. Rick
Liked to hunt wild mushrooms
In the starlight. Once he saw
Two giraffes with necks intertwined,
And he thought, "How nice would
It be if there were three, or even
Five!" Rick traversed many lands,
And he also traversed the red
Acres of language in the form
Of many books. He liked to read
Cookbooks, mainly, because he
Enjoyed looking at the pictures,
Especially cookbooks with a lot
Of mushrooms. Once when one of
Rick's women started blubbering,
He blew pipe smoke on a tiny bug.
"Ha! This rigid pantomime has
Got to end. The solitary tear
Of a good drama is one thing,
But this is quite another!" And
So the woman stopped, and she
Snuggled up to Rick. Their lungs
Filled with air, as they listened to
The song of the blue blue warmth.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; — *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933517522/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1933517522&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=BNEZMYCYTWF24CPV"&gt;The Bigger World&lt;/a&gt;*, Noelle Kocot, Wave Books, © 2013 by Noelle Kocot, pp. 11-12&lt;/blockquote&gt;Poems like this make me wish I knew more about narratology. I love the way it jumps from general characterizing statements ("was a polyamorous shaman", "had quite a lot of women") to very specific single-instance stories ("Once he saw", "Once when one of / Rick's women started blubbering"). There are, I have no doubt, specific terms for these sorts of differences. I love the way inconsequential details take on significance just by their being included: the giraffes, his side-career as a detective, the tiny bug.

Rick wants more of everything *except tears*. One giraffe isn't enough, one book isn't enough, one career isn't enough, one woman isn't enough, but one tear is plenty. It bothers me that I don't know where to go from here in my reading, but maybe that's a quality I really like in poems. Sure, I love it when a beautiful poem means something that I recognize as true, but I also love when a beautiful poem is just on the edge of meaning something, when I can only just make out the shape of something at the bottom of it but can never quite tell what. That, too, feels like a kind of truth.</content>

  <title type='text'>Weekly Wrap-up (July 27 - August 2)</title>
  <content type='html'>This was a long week. I've been closing up my work on a book review (finally done!) and prepping some internship applications (not quite as done).

I picked up some new books from the library, had my first &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/hurricane-birds-by-dawn-lonsinger-guest.html" target="blank"&gt;post by a guest&lt;/a&gt; (and wrote &lt;a href="http://retailmfa.blogspot.com/2014/07/tim-ellisons-analysis-of-fascination-of.html" target="blank"&gt;my first guest-post&lt;/a&gt;), wrote my review of Christian Wiman's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Bright-Abyss-Meditation-Believer/dp/0374534373" target="blank"&gt;My Bright Abyss&lt;/a&gt; (parts &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/my-bright-abyss-by-christian-wiman-part.html" target="blank"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/my-bright-abyss-by-christian-wiman-part_30.html" target="blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;), and looked at a couple poems (by &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/still-life-with-two-dead-peacocks-and.html" target="blank"&gt;Diane Seuss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/painting-exhibition-by-xi-murong.html" target="blank"&gt;Xi Murong&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe I'll start sharing a list of favorite poetry-related articles found around the web once each week. That's actually not a bad idea; might be a good idea for Fridays when people are in need of a little distraction. We'll see. Until tomorrow, all.</content>

  <title type='text'>New Books</title>
  <content type='html'>Yesterday I went to the Boston Public Library during my lunch break. I returned a bunch of books, including Christian Wiman's *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374534373/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0374534373&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=VBYD3TKQFMAXFFOV"&gt;My Bright Abyss&lt;/a&gt;* and *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393343944/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0393343944&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=AMVFQ2ESHGWOEUA6"&gt;Once&lt;/a&gt;* by &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/meghan-orourke" target="_blank"&gt;Meghan O'Rourke&lt;/a&gt;. I haven't mentioned *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393343944/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0393343944&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=AMVFQ2ESHGWOEUA6"&gt;Once&lt;/a&gt;* yet. I thought it was a good collection, though it wasn't my favorite. It had a couple poems ("Twenty-first Century Fireworks", "Extraneous") that I really enjoyed, but the rest left me flat. Still, I liked it better than the Pulitzer Prize winning *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1555975844/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1555975844&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=WLXEDNVPZRT4EVOG"&gt;Life on Mars&lt;/a&gt;* by Tracy K. Smith. That book was too abstracted, too life-lessony for my tastes. It was like a slightly less boring &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1883689597/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1883689597&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;linkId=3SPAUUOUSLDURO6S"&gt;William Bronk&lt;/a&gt;. Also, it bothered me to no end that there wasn't a picture of Mars on the cover.

&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933517522/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1933517522&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=F7HT2W2GWGO5OFRY" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=1933517522&amp;amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As usual, picked up about a half dozen new books. One I've already read twice and *really *enjoyed is *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933517522/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1933517522&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=5QTMNFFJP6YE7RTV"&gt;The Bigger World&lt;/a&gt;* by &lt;a href="http://www.wavepoetry.com/products/noelle-kocot"&gt;Noelle Kocot&lt;/a&gt;. Kocot writes these short narrative poems in a naive style, like a modern fairy tale or parable. Sometimes they sort of miss the mark and are just weird for weirdness's sake, but most of the time Kocot really nails some interesting point about psychology or relationships. Nobody has reviewed this one on Amazon yet, even though it's been out since 2011. I'll have to write something up. In the meantime, I highly recommend *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933517522/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1933517522&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=5QTMNFFJP6YE7RTV"&gt;The Bigger World&lt;/a&gt;*.

This morning I took some time to update &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/p/the-6789-project.html"&gt;the 6789 Project&lt;/a&gt; list and add a link to it on the main page. Now I've just got to make time to really think about and write about my own poems. So much to do. :-) </content>

I can't recommend this issue of Poetry East highly enough. There's some great poetry from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_Ting"&gt;Shu Ting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wis%C5%82awa_Szymborska"&gt;Wislawa Szymborska&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Murong"&gt;Xi Murong&lt;/a&gt;, among others. For today's Translation Thursday post, I want to share one of my favorites by Xi Murong, translated by Angela Ball and Jianqing Zheng.

Here's the poem, 'Painting Exhibition':
&lt;blockquote&gt;I know
All that is beautiful
Will never
Stay for
Anyone

So I hang
My love and grief
On the wall
For show and
For sale &lt;/blockquote&gt;Read that first stanza by itself and think about all the things she could have said afterward. "Beautiful things don't last so: 1) I'll immortalize them with my art; 2) I'll just give up; 3) I'll write about the ugly things that *do *last; 4) Carpe diem!" The list, I'm sure, could go on.

But she chooses to talk about money. Is it that she's given up on beauty? She seems to be saying that beauty isn't real, or isn't lasting, so you might as well make a buck with whatever you're able to assemble from your life. Maybe she's contrasting beauty with 'love and grief', as though they didn't belong in the category of&amp;nbsp; the beautiful. This puts a lot of weight on "My", a level of particularity in subtly contrast with the abstract "All that is beautiful". The implied metaphor — that parts of her life are hanging on the walls — makes this self-sacrifice (or self-betrayal) all the more poignant.&amp;nbsp;

This interpretation feels true to me, but I have no doubt there are others. It's amazing that so small a poem can reward continued reflection. Unfortunately, it's hard to find poems by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Murong"&gt;Xi Murong&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_Ting"&gt;Shu Ting&lt;/a&gt; in English, whereas there are translations available by their male contemporaries like &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080761548X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=080761548X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=W7BCCEN66AUI6ZJY"&gt;Gu Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939010704/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0939010704&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=MZOGAEWYJCCJ5AYO"&gt;Duo Duo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811218481/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0811218481&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=5BNRIHGG6RE42LCB"&gt;Bei Dao&lt;/a&gt;. Angela Ball and Jianqing Zheng have done great work with this poem; I hope they do more, and I hope others follow their lead.

  <title type='text'>The 6789 Project</title>
  <content type='html'>I've been slacking on my poetry writing. While I was living in England at the start of this year I submitted poems to about five different journals and was turned down by all of them (actually, one *still *hasn't said no -- it's been five months). It wasn't even that big of a fail, but it drained my enthusiasm. But now I'm ready to get back into the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So here's my plan. I'm going to submit my work exclusively to the sixty-seven journals that tied for eighty-ninth place in &lt;a href="http://cliffordgarstang.com/?p=4329"&gt;the 2014 Pushcart Prize Ranking of Literary Magazines for Poetry&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way I'll fill you all in on how it's coming along and what I've learned about the poetry writing / submitting / publishing process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, by the way, are the 67 89s. Some of them I've heard of, others are completely new to me, others still (Triplopia?) may not even exist. I guess that's something I'll be learning about. Writers, feel free to use this list as a resource:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anhinga Press&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.arroyoliteraryreview.com/?page_id=37"&gt;Arroyo Literary Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www2.potsdam.edu/henryrm/blueline/index.htm#Submission%20Guidelines"&gt;Blueline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bcreview.org/#!submit/colm"&gt;Briar Cliff Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://thechattahoocheereview.gpc.edu/submissions.htm"&gt;Chattahoochee Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cleveland State Univ.

  <title type='text'>My Bright Abyss by Christian Wiman (Part 2)</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374534373/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0374534373&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=ARUMN77E5JCPONJH" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=0374534373&amp;amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I want to share a paragraph from Christian Wiman's *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374534373/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0374534373&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=ARUMN77E5JCPONJH"&gt;My Bright Abyss: Meditation of a Modern Believer&lt;/a&gt;* and talk a bit about what it has to say about poetry. At this point in the book (the last chapter) Wiman has been reading through Robert Browning's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childe_Roland_to_the_Dark_Tower_Came" target="_blank"&gt;'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came'&lt;/a&gt;. Roland has just come to the Dark Tower, where he is surrounded by "all the other knights, who have made their way to this place—the price of entry to which, [Roland] realizes all too clearly, is death" (p. 173). It is of course relevant to Wiman's own story. Wiman is dying of inoperable cancer. Roland's last act before death is to raise his "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slughorn" target="_blank"&gt;slug-horn&lt;/a&gt;" to his lips and blow one last note. Here's how Wiman interprets Browning's poem:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Triumph or defeat? Redemption or oblivion? The knight knows he's going to die, but he is "dauntless." He is at the edge where all human action fails, and he is acting. Auden once described poetry as "the clear expression of mixed feelings": this is the clear expression of an ambivalent action. Or no, not ambivalent. The very opposite of that, in fact. The knight's last action is inscrutable, unknowable, but it is also mysteriously decisive. It is, like a poem, so sealed in by and replete with meaning that there is nothing outside of the act to translate it: it is only—*it is utterly*—itself. To fling yourself into failure; to soar into the sadness by which you've lived; to die with neither defiance nor submission, but in some higher fusion of the two; to walk lost at the last into the arms of emptiness, crying the miracles of God.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; — *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374534373/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0374534373&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=ARUMN77E5JCPONJH"&gt;My Bright Abyss: Meditation of a Modern Believer&lt;/a&gt;*, Christian Wiman, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, © 2013, p. 174&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A poem is an action, a cry. How much meaning can a cry contain? "Not much," you might think. "A cry is pure voice. There's no reason in it. Babies can do it; how meaningful could it be?" But its universality is precisely why it is meaningful. The cry is pure form, a raw assertion of humanness. Just as every word spoken or written in English is an assertion of Englishness and every word spoken or written in Chinese is an assertion of Chineseness, every cry is an assertion of humanness. The cry, no matter what is being cried, says, "I am." The blast of Roland's "slug-horn" is the transformation of his breath into music. His breath, his life, becomes music to assert that *he lives, he is*. Every poem does the same.

And why assert our existence, and to whom? "God," Wiman would say. Fine with me. I would probably say "the Universe" or "Existence" or "Humanity", but I think Wiman and I mean very nearly the same thing. As Wiman says, the cry is "neither defiance nor submission, but ... some higher fusion of the two". What a beautiful definition of poetry, though I might tweak it a little: *&lt;b&gt;a higher fusion of defiance and praise&lt;/b&gt;*.

Ah, there's always too much to say. A criticism of Wiman: he leaves practically no room open for light or incidental verse. But whatever; that's just not his style. As much as I wrestled with Wiman's Christian vision of the world, I would read it again. It said a lot of things I've been thinking about; it just said them in ways that I didn't want to hear. I need to get over that prejudice.

Tomorrow I'm going to read something fun, that's for damn sure. Until then, everybody.</content>

  <title type='text'>My Bright Abyss by Christian Wiman (Part 1)</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374534373/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0374534373&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=ARUMN77E5JCPONJH" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=0374534373&amp;amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It's tough to review Christian Wiman's *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374534373/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0374534373&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=ARUMN77E5JCPONJH"&gt;My Bright Abyss: Meditation of a Modern Believer&lt;/a&gt;*. I think I need to recuse myself.

First things first, though: this is a really interesting book to read as a poet. That's why I picked it up in the first place; I got it at the library the same I day I got Richard Blanco's &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/for-all-of-us-one-today-inaugural-poets.html" target="_blank"&gt;For All of Us, One Today&lt;/a&gt;. Poetic biography — in which a poet's work is placed within her or his life narrative — is one of my favorite genres. (I highly recommend Dante's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199540659/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0199540659&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=FV44AD2QNPHW5GGS"&gt;Vita Nuova&lt;/a&gt; and Richard Ellmann's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393008592/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0393008592&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=CCB3EH5S6GXFNTEN"&gt;Yeats: The Man and the Masks&lt;/a&gt;.) Wiman has some very interesting analyses of his own poems, locating his religious and poetic impulses in the same complicated source. Which is not at all to say that his poems are hymns. Here's a much darker toned poem that I was blown away by.&amp;nbsp; It's titled "Commute (I)":

&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;O the screech and heat and hate
we have for each day's commute,

the long wait at the last stop
before we go screaming

underground, while the pigeons
court and shit and rut

insolently on the tracks
because this train is always late,

always aimed at only us,
who when it comes with its

blunt snout, its thousand mouths,
cram and curse and contort

into one creature, all claws and eyes,
tunneling, tunneling, tunneling

toward money.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; — *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374534373/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0374534373&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=ARUMN77E5JCPONJH"&gt;My Bright Abyss: Meditation of a Modern Believer&lt;/a&gt;*, Christian Wiman, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, © 2013, p. 88&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second, Wiman's engagement with his own mortality is striking. Wiman is dying of untreatable cancer. It's noble, really, the dignity and clarity of feeling with which he approaches his own death. Not to say that he's Stoic —  by no means. He's fully engaged with his own suffering, which he occasionally describes in stomach-churning detail, and the suffering that his death will bring to his wife and children. It's tempting to think Wiman is returning to the Christian faith of his childhood for comfort in the face of death, the easy relief of belief. That's not the case, but even if it were *could you blame him*?

So here's where I have to recuse myself: I find Wiman's Christianity aggravating to the point of distraction. He comes from West Texas, I come from California's Central Valley — similar worlds with similar languages. "The world" exists opposite "God". "Human love" isn't real compared to or only draws its reality from "God's love". All those atheists are just so sad and angry and lost without faith in God (though, of course, you've never met a single atheist, or if you have she's lived in a town surrounded by people who think she's going to Hell so how exactly could she not be sad and angry and lost?). And here's one that we desert dwellers love: the liberal "Moderns" in the big cities have forgotten the hard truths learned in the land and the Bible.

I wouldn't say I no longer believe in God, but I certainly don't believe in this way of talking about God anymore. There are people who speak this language who are profoundly good people, but *even if it gives them certain strengths then it also gives them certain weaknesses*. It's provincial and inhumane, and I know it from experience to be the foundation for a lot of authoritarian, patriarchal, stultifying nonsense.

But here's the thing: I know that Wiman is more subtle and self-conscious about Christianity than anybody I knew back at home. For every statement I just listed as typically Christian, I could find a passage in *&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374534373/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0374534373&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20&amp;amp;linkId=ARUMN77E5JCPONJH"&gt;My Bright Abyss&lt;/a&gt;* that counters it. Wiman always resists easy answers; he even resists the hard answers so that you never feel (as he never feels) on solid ground. My revulsion at his Christian vocabulary is visceral and irrational. So I'm not being an impartial judge. I resent Wiman for using the language of Christianity because it touches a raw nerve, a deep embarrassment that I used to think that way, or perhaps an even deeper fear that I *still* think that way.

I'll have to continue this review tomorrow. But here's something that interests me, something that's really at the heart of my writing: dispelling the myth of the impartial judge. As a blogger or reviewer or critic or whatever it is I'm doing here, can I ever really hope to escape from my origins? Can I become cosmopolitan without first becoming more honestly who I am, which is to say, the accumulation of all the things I have been? And if I can escape my origins and become cosmopolitan, is that even a good thing? I think Wiman has a lot to say about that, even if I don't exactly want to hear it the way he wants to say it. More on that tomorrow.</content>

  <title type='text'>'Hurricane Birds' by Dawn Lonsinger -- a Guest Post by Darrell Dela Cruz</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Today I'm featuring a guest post by Darrell Dela Cruz, who runs the poetry analysis blog &lt;a href="http://retailmfa.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;A Retail Life After the MFA&lt;/a&gt;. Darrell says he is open to people telling him that he’s wrong in his analysis – even the poets who wrote the piece.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;He’s also a contributor to &lt;a href="http://billknott.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"&gt;the Bill Knott Criticism blog&lt;/a&gt;, where he analyzes the life’s work of Bill Knott, who died earlier this year. Darrell will be featuring one of my poem analyses on his blog this week (EDIT: &lt;a href="http://retailmfa.blogspot.com/2014/07/tim-ellisons-analysis-of-fascination-of.html" target="_blank"&gt;here's the link!&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;This poem is a mixture of image and narrative, and by the style of the poem – a very upfront, visually focused poem, the end of the poem comes as a surprise.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;So the poem starts in medias res from the perspective of the speaker, “In the eye of the storm we came / up out of basements and found sea birds in our yards—" The key with the first two lines is the communal nature of the speaker.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The “we” and “our” brings a bigger, yet personal setting with the image of “backyards.”&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Why?&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;They are survivors of an event which the communal speaker emphasizes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;And as to parallel, there’s also a community of birds which mimic reconstruction, “gulls and terns stockpiling debris, and frigate birds gliding / flawless over the interstate.”&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I think the key words in these lines is “flawless” – yes, the action happening seems like recovery and everything fits in the right place, but “flawless” doesn’t.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The idea of “without flaw” happening in these lines seems a bit cynical on one hand, but a bit ironic on the other.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It’s here where the authorial intrusion comes in as perspective rather than observer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;“A white ibis crawled out of / the gutter and loosed its looped limbs into the air.”&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Note how precise and focused the image is to the singular and also the alliteration as well – the further the poem goes the more surreal the images become, but also the more barbed the descriptions become as well.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Then this statement “Petrels and doves swarmed wet parking lots” seems a bit more curt in tone.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The more expansive the scene gets, the more it is inescapable due to the amount of “hurricane birds” serving as a reminder of the hurricane.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;“What glistened overwhelmed us, swallows rising / like a sheet over the injured.”&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;So the ending is a surprise because the simile seems so obvious but was sort of lost due to the constant images of birds.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;But it makes sense, right?&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The poem starts out from this communal speaker and ends with the community “overwhelmed” and when the swallows rise then the image – the insight – of the situation becomes actualized by “sheet over the injured” – does this mean dead? Not necessarily.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The part that people don’t want to see, but know exists – note that the damage of place wasn’t described or the emotional damage of “survivors” – just the description of birds reconstructing as though nothing was ever amiss.

  <title type='text'>'Still-Life with Two Dead Peacocks and a Girl (after Rembrandt)' by Diane Seuss</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Rembrandt_-_Still-Life_with_Two_Dead_Peacocks_and_a_Girl_-_WGA19253.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Rembrandt_-_Still-Life_with_Two_Dead_Peacocks_and_a_Girl_-_WGA19253.jpg" height="320" width="299" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Today I'm reading &lt;a href="http://www.missourireview.com/archives/diane-seuss-still-life-with-two-dead-peacocks-and-a-girl-after-rembrandt/"&gt;'Still-Life with Two Dead Peacocks and a Girl (after Rembrandt)'&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/diane-seuss"&gt;Diane Seuss&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="http://www.missourireview.com/"&gt;The Missouri Review&lt;/a&gt;'s new summer issue. This is the second poem by Diane Seuss &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/long-long-ago-i-used-to-smoke-in-bed-by.html"&gt;that I've read here on the blog&lt;/a&gt;, and I've quickly become a fan of her work.

This poem is based on a painting by Rembrandt. As Seuss &lt;a href=""http://www.missourireview.com/archives/diane-seuss-still-life-with-two-dead-peacocks-and-a-girl-after-rembrandt/""&gt;explains on The Missouri Review website&lt;/a&gt;, she wrote the poem with some rules in mind. "I placed some strict limitations upon myself: 14 lines, 17 syllables per line (what Allen Ginsberg called “American Sentences”), and no “I.”"

Anyway, without too much more ado, here's 'Still-Life with Two Dead Peacocks and a Girl (after Rembrandt)':
&lt;blockquote&gt;She comes out of the dark seeking pie, but instead finds two dead peacocks.
One is strung up by its feet. The other lies on its side in a pool
of its own blood. The girl is burdened with curly bangs. A too-small cap.
She wanted pie, not these beautiful birds. Not a small, dusky apple
from a basket of dusky apples. Reach in. Choose a dusky apple.
She sleepwalked to this window, her body led by its hunger for pie.
Instead this dead beauty, gratuitous. Scalloped green feathers. Gold breast.
Iridescent-eyed plumage, supine on the table. Two gaudy crowns.
She rests her elbows on the stone windowsill. Why not pluck a feather?
Why lean against the gold house of the rich and stare at the bird’s dead eye?
The girl must pull the heavy bird into the night and run off with it.
Build a fire on the riverbank. Tear away the beautiful feathers.
Suck scorched tough dark meat off of hollow bones. Look at her, ready to reach.
She’d hoped for pie. Meringue beaded gold. Art, useless as tits on a boar. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Before I even begin to interpret the poem I love it. I love the playfulness of the language, the sense of discord between the girl's sweet tooth and the artist's baroque subject. But the poem does have some interesting things to say (or it invites the reader to say some interesting things) about art. What is art for? Why do we come to it? So many times when I travel to a foreign city (London, Paris, wherever) I'll check out the museums. Why? What is it we expect to find there? One answer is "entertainment". Perhaps this is analogous to the pie that the girl wants. But even if there's something more to be found other than entertainment, will someone who comes seeking entertainment really even be able to find it? Put less (or more) awkwardly &amp;#8212; if we come looking for food but instead find beauty, will we appreciate the beauty, or will we simply try to eat it? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus end my musings. They feel even more useless than usual today. Though it is later than I usually write and I'm a little hungry, so maybe that's just bringing my mood down a bit. Maybe there's some pie in the kitchen....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/still-life-with-two-dead-peacocks-and.html" data-text="Reading a poem by @dlseuss" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F07%2Fstill-life-with-two-dead-peacocks-and.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Weekly Wrap-Up (July 20 - 26, 2014)</title>
  <content type='html'>Hey all! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been a good week, I think. Actually, it's been a very good month! Yesterday was the blog's first monthiversary. It's been fun connecting with readers, poets, and other bloggers here and on Twitter and on Reddit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This week I read a couple poems in translation from the latest issue of &lt;a href="http://www.poetryeast.org/"&gt;Poetry East&lt;/a&gt;. Those were &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/an-impression-by-gu-cheng.html"&gt;'An Impression'&lt;/a&gt; by Gu Cheng and &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/say-more-speak-like-rain-by-arne-ruste.html"&gt;'Say More, Speak Like Rain'&lt;/a&gt; by Arne Ruste. &lt;a href="http://www.poetryeast.org/"&gt;Poetry East&lt;/a&gt; also had a great poem by George Bogin, &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/still-life-by-george-bogin.html"&gt;'Still Life'&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also read &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/falling-in-love-with-fiji-mermaid-by.html"&gt;'Falling in Love with a Fiji Mermaid'&lt;/a&gt; by Grant Clauser (from &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/"&gt;The American Poetry Review&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/storm-and-sturgeon-by-devin-johnston.html"&gt;'Storm and Sturgeon'&lt;/a&gt; from Devin Johnston's book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Traveler-Poems-Devin-Johnston/dp/0374533482"&gt;*Traveler*&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Wednesday I wrote &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/poetry-doesnt-matter.html"&gt;a bit of a rant&lt;/a&gt; against the New York Times' 'Does Poetry Matter?' articles. I concluded that, of course, poetry doesn't matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking forward to the coming week!</content>

  <title type='text'>'Storm and Sturgeon' by Devin Johnston</title>
  <content type='html'>I went to a poetry reading last night in Cambridge, MA. It was... I don't really know what to say about it. A few of the poets who read were interesting or compelling in their presentation, but I couldn't tell exactly what they were getting at other than *so much anxiety*. The others weren't really interesting in presentation or subject matter.

I'm lucky that I've attended some very good poetry readings. I heard Joyce Carol Oates read a poem of hers that made the audience crack up with laughter. I heard some amateur poets in Fresno, CA who really just nailed it. Biggest of all for me, I saw Turner read from *Here, Bullet *when I was a student at Fresno State and he was just starting to teach there. He was amazing. And then of course I've seen amateur and professional productions of Shakespeare that were incredibly funny and moving. Poetry *&lt;b&gt;can &lt;/b&gt;*keep you on the edge of your seat. Poetry can *&lt;b&gt;communicate&lt;/b&gt;*. That's why even though last night's reading was a bit of a disappointment, I'll keep going back to readings on the off chance that someone might have something to say. Because I would very much like to hear it.

&lt;img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=0374533482&amp;amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=timreapoe-20" /&gt;So, for today's poem. I've been reading Devin Johnston's 2011 book *Traveler* (a beautiful little book published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux). I have some negative criticisms, but I feel like all of them are unfair. Sometimes I'll read a poem that's very specific to Johnston's experiences in the Midwest or his travels in Scotland and the unfamiliar place names and vocabulary will turn me off. But I've found that, when I bother to look up the unfamiliar words and references, Johnston is being very considerate in his choices. Knowledge always adds to the experience of his poems. I've been thinking that poetry should be, as Poetry East editor Richard Jones puts it, &lt;a href="http://www.poetryeast.org/about.html" target="blank"&gt;"immediate, accessible, and universal"&lt;/a&gt;. But Johnston makes me think a real craftsman can ask you to go further, to participate and work more as a reader.

Here's one of the poems I loved immediately, though it certainly has its own mysteries to explore. It's called 'Storm and Sturgeon':


&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;When a thunderstorm
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;trundles down the Wabash,
revealing the form
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of flow in every flash,
northerlies lash
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the walls that keep us warm,
rummaging grass,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;scattering flock and swarm.

Beneath an icy
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;column thick as phlegm,
this cold coyote
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of our river system
peers through a scrim
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of silt and leaf debris
as lighting skims
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the shoals of Harmonie.

As each percussion
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;shakes the sturgeon's bladder—
a loose vibration
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;felt in fleshy matter—
her switch-tail stirs
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;beds of hibernation,
bottom dwellers
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;lost in cloud formations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I want to unpack this a little. There's the first level of understanding the references. I've lived my entire life in California and New England. Even though I've had the good fortune to go on three long drives across the country, references to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabash_River" target="blank"&gt;Wabash&lt;/a&gt; and Harmonie are lost on me. But when I do look them up I understand that this poem is located in a very specific place — &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Harmony,_Indiana" target="blank"&gt;New Harmony, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;. New Harmony was founded by German immigrants, which is why Johnston uses the German "Harmonie".

But of course "German immigrants" is being much too simplistic. They were religious refugees, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_Society" target="blank"&gt;the Harmony Society&lt;/a&gt;. The same group founded the town of Harmony, Pennsylvania. They were fond of music. All of a sudden word choices like "percussion" make sense in a different way.

There are so many ways to interpret this poem, even with the little we've dug up so far. Is the thunderstorm supposed to be God? His thundering voice shakes through the flesh of the mortals below, mortals like the Harmony Society? Or is it more about history in the way that I think Johnston's poem &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/06/telephone-by-devin-johnston.html" target="blank"&gt;'Telephone'&lt;/a&gt;, the strange contingency and interconnectedness of history? Are all of us are just "bottom dwellers / lost in cloud formations", unable to make any real sense of the forces moving at higher levels than ourselves?

I highly recommend Devin Johnston's *Traveler*. He has several more books available, and FSG is bringing out a new collection in March of 2015. Have a great Friday, everyone.</content>

  <title type='text'>'An Impression' by Gu Cheng</title>
  <content type='html'>Yesterday I went to the Boston Public Library and pulled out a couple books of poetry I've had my eye on — Devin Johnston's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Traveler-Poems-Devin-Johnston/dp/0374279330" target="blank"&gt;Traveler &lt;/a&gt;and Tracy K. Smith's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Mars-Tracy-K-Smith/dp/1555975844" target="blank"&gt;Life on Mars&lt;/a&gt;. I'm excited to read both of those. I grabbed a couple of other books that looked interesting (I'm a sucker for a book cover and a good title), one of which I read last night and found almost impossible to read. I try to always be open to surprises when I read, but this book just had absolutely nothing I could grab onto. I couldn't tell you what a single poem was about. I could get super negative about that, but instead (Pollyanna that I am) I let it remind me how *good* good poetry really is. If things can go *this wrong*, it's amazing when things go right.
Too much positivity? Yeah, it's a bit saccharine. But that's part of the process, that back and forth between saccharine and cynical. Everything I know about writing I learned from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacking_%28sailing%29" target="blank"&gt;what little I've misunderstood about tacking&lt;/a&gt;. That's an exaggeration of course, but that's all part of it.
Today's my first Translation Thursday poem! Though it's not the first translated poem that I've covered (see &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/elegy-for-road-by-tatiana-oro.html" target="blank"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/say-more-speak-like-rain-by-arne-ruste.html" target="blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), it is the first that I've done on a Thursday, and it's the first to which I'll affix #translationthurs when I post on Twitter.
I'm looking at 'An Impression' by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu_Cheng" target="blank"&gt;Gu Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, translated from the Chinese by Ginny MacKenzie and Wei Guo. It appears in the absolutely amazing Spring 2014 issue of &lt;a href="http://www.poetryeast.org/" target="blank"&gt;Poetry East&lt;/a&gt;. Here's the poem:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The sky is gray
The road is gray
The building is gray
The rain is gray

Through this dead gray
Come two children
One in bright red
One in tender green &lt;/blockquote&gt;Isn't the way those colors pop in the end just amazing? The poet lulls you into this aural and visual rhythm (gray...gray...gray...gray...gray) and then breaks it open in a burst of color right at the end. Kudos to the translators Ginny MacKenzie and Wei Guo for really nailing this. Its simplicity reminds me so much of Ezra Pound's &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/104/106.html" target="blank"&gt;In a Station of the Metro&lt;/a&gt;.
But it's not really that simple is it? We move from the sky, to the road, to the building, to the rain. Why that order? Why wouldn't rain be after sky? Maybe it's so that the eye moves in a particular direction, from the horizon of sky along the road to the building immediately in front of us to the rain that falls on us. The rain isn't rain in the abstract, as it would be if it came after sky. It's the rain that's soaking our clothes and our hair or tapping nervously on our umbrella. All these gray things are all around us, falling on us, until the two children enter.
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu_Cheng" target="blank"&gt;Gu Cheng&lt;/a&gt; died in 1993. He was only 37 years old. He was one of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Poets" target="blank"&gt;Misty Poets&lt;/a&gt;, a group that includes Shu Ting, whose poems are also featured in this issue of &lt;a href="http://www.poetryeast.org/" target="blank"&gt;Poetry East&lt;/a&gt;. (Really, &lt;a href="http://www.poetryeast.org/orders.html" target="blank"&gt;buy a copy, or save $5 and subscribe&lt;/a&gt;.) If you'd like to read more Gu Cheng, there's a poetry collection available called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nameless-Flowers-Selected-Poems-Cheng/dp/080761548X/" target="blank"&gt;Nameless Flowers&lt;/a&gt;. Have a great day, all.</content>

  <title type='text'>Poetry Doesn't Matter</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/18/does-poetry-matter" target="blank"&gt;*The New York Times *&lt;/a&gt;wants very badly to convince you that poetry matters. Seven poets and critics, including Pulitzer winners &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/18/does-poetry-matter/wipe-that-smirk-off-your-poem" target="blank"&gt;Tracy K. Smith &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/18/does-poetry-matter/is-poetry-popular-whos-counting" target="blank"&gt;Paul Muldoon&lt;/a&gt;, took time out of their busy poetry schedules to convince us that poetry matters. Even &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/18/does-poetry-matter/poetry-requires-an-education-of-the-senses" target="blank"&gt;William Logan &lt;/a&gt;came out of his troll cave to make the case that poetry matters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But of course *&lt;b&gt;poetry doesn't matter&lt;/b&gt;*. It doesn't matter in the ways that AIDS research matters, it doesn't matter in the way that fixing the education system matters, it doesn't matter in the way that making sure your kids are fed a healthy breakfast each morning matters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;But just because it doesn't matter doesn't mean we should stop doing it. &lt;/b&gt;Not everything we do has to matter in some profound way. It's OK to do things *just because you like them*. For me these "poetry matters" arguments are evidence of a deep shame in the face of pleasure (possibly because so many poets depend upon the oh-so-serious academic institutions?). Can we please stop being ashamed of the pleasure that reading and writing bring? Can we please be a bit more hedonistic about poetry?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And a little bit less religious? David Biespiel tweeted about &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/18/does-poetry-matter/poems-hold-the-mysteries-of-the-present-dreams-of-the-future" target="blank"&gt;his contribution to *The New York Times' *poetry panel &lt;/a&gt;and received this reply among others: &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DavidBiespiel"&gt;@DavidBiespiel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kenyonreview"&gt;@kenyonreview&lt;/a&gt; Excellent piece! Very well said. But how to get non-poets to read poetry? Your essay in the NYT might help.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cortney Davis (@nurseprolife) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nurseprolife/statuses/491273657616834560"&gt;July 21, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;Why should we care whether "non-poets" read poetry? Is that what all this is about? Converting people? &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/18/does-poetry-matter/poetry-requires-an-education-of-the-senses" target="blank"&gt;William Logan &lt;/a&gt;writes: "When it is once more taken seriously in the schools, poetry will be loved again...." What is this golden age of poetry appreciation that we're trying to get back to, and why must poets and poetry lovers be so desperate for its second coming? How will I recognize the poetry messiah when he comes?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If poetry matters *to you*, good *for you*. Enjoy it. Buy books by the poets you like. Talk about the poems you like, or don't. But please appreciate that there are people who really like jai alai, love to play jai alai with their jai alai-loving friends, don't really care for poetry but are just nuts about jai alai, and note that they don't bother writing en masse into *The New York Times* to tell everyone &amp;#8212; in some weird preemptive act of self-defense &amp;#8212; why it matters. Because it doesn't matter in some profound sense, and neither does poetry, and that's ok.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F07%2Fpoetry-doesnt-matter.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=standard&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=true&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=80" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:80px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Still Life' by George Bogin</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I'm having one of those days where I question what I'm doing, how I'm doing it, why I'm doing it. (Warning: I'm about to emote, so you can just scroll down to the poem if you're just here for the poem.) Maybe it's just because I didn't get much sleep? So much of a negative affect is simply a manifestation of physical strains like hunger or fatigue. But I feel like this blog is getting away from me a little, like I'm just going through the motions. But maybe that's the point. It's a discipline. It's a discipline of discovery. I've wanted to learn more about contemporary poetry and this blog is my way of doing it. I recognize this malaise, though. I've experienced it before with other of my projects that have collapsed. The important thing right now is not to give in to doubts. My brain's going to give me a thousand reasons why none of what I'm doing is important and it's going to tell me that I should stop. It's going to say: "This should be easy! This should be fun! Why are you doing it if it isn't easy and fun all the time?" But it is a discipline, it is hard. The important thing is to find a way to enjoy the difficulty. I think a word for that is pride. And I am proud of what I'm doing here, strangely enough. Embarrassed sometimes, yes, but always proud. And the embarrassment is less and less every day, and the sense of pride grows. And sometimes you just have to keep your head down and march forward and trust that you made the right decision when you started the thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wow, I'm being so tiresome, huh? Let's get to some poetry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even before the series of events that led to me being very tired and a bit cranky and annoyingly introspective I had decided to read 'Still Life' by George Bogin for today's blog post. It appears in the Spring 2014 issue of &lt;a href="http://www.poetryeast.org/"&gt;*Poetry East*&lt;/a&gt;, which I can't recommend highly enough. Other journals I've discussed here on the blog so far have been a mixed bag, you know? Each has had a lot of poems that I chose not to cover because they didn't really speak to me. With *Poetry East* it's an opposite case. There are *so many* poems of *such high quality* that I don't want to spoil them for you. Seriously, there's hardly a single poem in this issue that I don't enjoy. &lt;a href="http://www.poetryeast.org/orders.html"&gt;Buy a copy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But to get to the point. Here's 'Still Life' by George Bogin.  &lt;blockquote&gt;A song&lt;br/&gt;is being sung here&lt;br/&gt;of my room&lt;br/&gt;and the objects&lt;br/&gt;in the room.&lt;br/&gt;The room lies&lt;br/&gt;in the arms&lt;br/&gt;of the house&lt;br/&gt;and the house&lt;br/&gt;floats&lt;br/&gt;in the afternoon.&lt;br/&gt;The windows&lt;br/&gt;give on trees&lt;br/&gt;and the &lt;br/&gt;grave late sun&lt;br/&gt;enters.&lt;br/&gt;On the desk&lt;br/&gt;wait&lt;br/&gt;an apple,&lt;br/&gt;a napkin,&lt;br/&gt;a pair of glasses,&lt;br/&gt;a lamp&lt;br/&gt;and a book.&lt;br/&gt;A chair&lt;br/&gt;stands by.&lt;br/&gt;Time brushes&lt;br/&gt;these objects&lt;br/&gt;and shadows&lt;br/&gt;fall from them.&lt;br/&gt;All things&lt;br/&gt;sing the song,&lt;br/&gt;the song&lt;br/&gt;of the sadness&lt;br/&gt;of objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I started learning to play the piano when I was about ten years old, and a couple years later I started learning to play guitar. (Yeah, it's my blog, so I'm gonna talk about myself again.) From the beginning, I just wanted to play the music of Nobuo Uematsu on the piano, though like most other kids I got stuck playing from Bastien books. I would sit at the piano and poke around at the keys until I could recreate a melody from Final Fantasy III or Chrono Trigger. When I started playing the guitar (in 1997, the same year George Bogin died) I was more interested in writing my own music. The process of composing music is halfway between invention and discovery. You search for the right note, the note that you hear in your head, the notes that you've heard but never *really* heard. For me, I don't really *write* a song so much as I draw it fully formed from somewhere between silence and noise. That sounds pretentious because it sounds mysterious. But *it is mysterious*. In my very quiet childhood there was a song vibrating in every stifling room and I felt the need to bring it out as melody. The same thing happens with poetic lines. They just sort of appear in my head, fully formed. Who knows how long they've been sitting there, quietly taking shape, before they appear as words. Then I set them down on paper and over the course of several drafts other words crystallize around them with an irrefutable logic, or at least a logic that is irrefutable for me. &lt;b&gt;*The song is always already there.*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I'll read one last poem from &lt;a href="http://www.poetryeast.org/"&gt;*Poetry East*&lt;/a&gt; as part of my first Translation Thursday post. (EDIT: Just realized it's only Tuesday, making the previous sentence fairly ridiculous. FML.) I'm gonna get more sleep so that I can be a bit less emotive. Until then.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Say More, Speak Like Rain' by Arne Ruste</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today I'm reading 'Say More, Speak Like Rain' by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Ruste"&gt;Arne Ruste&lt;/a&gt;, a Norwegian poet, novelist, essayist, etc. who as yet has never had a single one of his books translated into English. Olav Grinde translated Ruste's poem for the Spring 2014 issue of &lt;a href="http://www.poetryeast.org/"&gt;*Poetry East*&lt;/a&gt;. My wife bought me my copy of *Poetry East *as an anniversary present and it's become one of my favorites in my growing collection of poetry journals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the first of my &lt;b&gt;Motivation Monday &lt;/b&gt;posts, and I take as my first point of motivation that *&lt;b&gt;there are so many amazing poems waiting to be found&lt;/b&gt;*. There are great poets (some famous, some obscure) writing here in the U.S. and in other countries and languages all across the globe. There's no end of surprise. Keep looking and you'll keep finding. And (amazing to me) there are translators like Olav Grinde who are willing to take on the onerous task of spreading the word, often with no compensation but pride and the knowledge of a job well done. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lucky for us, Poetry East makes the poem available for free &lt;a href="http://www.poetryeast.org/sample.htm"&gt;on their website&lt;/a&gt;, so I'm going to post it here along with my strong encouragement that you &lt;a href="http://www.poetryeast.org/orders.html"&gt;buy a copy of Poetry East &lt;/a&gt;online or at your local bookstore. So here's "Say More, Speak Like Rain':&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Am I perhaps&lt;br/&gt;the only believer now?&lt;br/&gt;I believe in words&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe in the carrying capacity&lt;br/&gt;of words in the power of their&lt;br/&gt;relativity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe in&lt;br/&gt;the parable, the paradox, the poem&lt;br/&gt;and in the stories&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;of old men&lt;br/&gt;told over fences, and I&lt;br/&gt;believe in the soft&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;things of this world, in wood and&lt;br/&gt;clay, that they will outlive&lt;br/&gt;steel and concrete&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;human things are what I&lt;br/&gt;believe in, the penetrating&lt;br/&gt;power of gentleness&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and I believe in things&lt;br/&gt;that take a long time to make,&lt;br/&gt;like trees and books&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;but I no longer believe&lt;br/&gt;in the good deeds&lt;br/&gt;of this world&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I no longer believe in&lt;br/&gt;heroism, I believe&lt;br/&gt;in good-naturedness&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and in words spoken by simple people,&lt;br/&gt;simple words woven together&lt;br/&gt;like baskets for carrying&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I put my stock&lt;br/&gt;in stamp collectors&lt;br/&gt;and the owners&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;of small shops and&lt;br/&gt;country inns, carpenters&lt;br/&gt;and flower-women&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no big&lt;br/&gt;words in this world, only&lt;br/&gt;loudmouths and demagogues&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collapse of words is a conceited fiction&lt;br/&gt;Words hold everything together&lt;br/&gt;Words connect everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe&lt;br/&gt;in café talk and&lt;br/&gt;in coffee-break talk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe in prayers, narrow&lt;br/&gt;strips of words, weightless and golden&lt;br/&gt;burnable, spread to the winds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe in&lt;br/&gt;confessions whispered in darkness&lt;br/&gt;and in letters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe in ballads and in&lt;br/&gt;curses of a sincere heart&lt;br/&gt;I want words&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;like deep axe cuts and clinging&lt;br/&gt;mallets. I want&lt;br/&gt;words&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;like shiny stones in my pocket,&lt;br/&gt;words like thrown arrows&lt;br/&gt;I want words&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;like the years in a worn down&lt;br/&gt;table. Maybe I am the last&lt;br/&gt;believer now:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe in blind man's&lt;br/&gt;never faltering fumbling over a writing&lt;br/&gt;of flaming points &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a long time now I've been looking for ways to express what it is I want out of poetry and art and music and, well, Life. Arne Ruste's poem shows me so much of what I've been looking for. I feel deeply the lines: "I no longer believe / in heroism; I believe / in good-naturedness". A kind word is an act of tremendous power. So is a beautiful phrase, or a true phrase, or a silly phrase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love what Ruste is saying about multiplicity, or perhaps *&lt;b&gt;pluralism &lt;/b&gt;*is a better word. The title is relevant, of course, but I notice a phrase from the second-to-last line: "never faltering fumbling". This could be easily labeled oxymoronic, but I think it's a beautiful sentiment that *absolves our words from judgment*. Words are things, like a basket, like a stone, like rain. There are no inherently good words or bad words. The more words there are, the richer the world is. Art, literature, music &amp;#8212; let there be more of them, more and more and more of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I should add, however, that I'm wary of the politics this poem might imply for some people. I don't believe in "simple people", as Ruste puts it. No people are simple. Believing there are such things as "simple people" is a step toward becoming one of the "loudmouths and demagogues" that the poet vilifies. But I won't cast the poem off just because of this. I know that this poem isn't perfect. I know that no poem is perfect. I know that the perfect poem will never be written, and that makes me glad. Because the perfect poem would be the last poem, and there can be no last poem. No arrangement of words is sufficient; we always need more words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I could just go on and on about this poem. I'll look at a few more poems from the Spring 2014 *Poetry East *this week. &lt;a href="http://www.poetryeast.org/orders.html"&gt;Get yourself a copy&lt;/a&gt;. Until tomorrow, friends.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Falling in Love with a Fiji Mermaid' by Grant Clauser</title>
  <content type='html'>Today I'm reading 'Falling in Love with a Fiji Mermaid' by &lt;a href="http://www.pw.org/content/grant_clauser" target="blank"&gt;Grant Clauser&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of three poems by Clauser in the latest issue of &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/" target="_blank"&gt;The American Poetry Review&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fa%2Fae%2FFeejee_mermaid.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fiji Mermaid" border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Feejee_mermaid.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Clauser provides a helpful explanatory note at the top of the poem: "Fiji mermaids were common gaffs at carnival sideshows. They were usually made by combining the head and torso of a monkey with the tail of a fish." The fictional creature has &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji_mermaid" target="blank"&gt;an interesting history&lt;/a&gt;. To the right is one of the least horrifying images of a Fiji mermaid that you can find online. A Fiji mermaid was featured on an episode of *The X-Files *back in 1995, at which point I would have been ten years old, and I've successfully repressed that memory until today when I foolishly plugged "Fiji Mermaid" into Google Images.

Anyway, back to the poem. The poem draws on that carnival sideshow tradition that asks you to believe things that simply can't be true and applies it, with powerful effect, to a failing relationship. Love, or the desire to be in love, can make you believe your imagination over your senses. "It's easy to confuse lies / for love, / believe that the palm reader / wasn't out to pick your pocket." Our desires lead us into fantasies. "It's cheap to dream / of such things, / coral meadows where / bull sharks menace / mermaids to their caves. / Where Fiji women toss / their stillborn babies to the sea / and they come back / remade by waves." And this would go on but that "in the end / the carney calls you / back to the midway light. / No time left for fantasy."

I've talked before about how much I dislike poem titles, but I think this is a really good one. It could easily have been called "Love Is a Fiji Mermaid" or "Love Is Like a Fiji Mermaid", but that wouldn't have given the same shade of meaning. Saying "Falling in Love with a Fiji Mermaid" shows that falling in love (I want to say "when it's not *really *love" but maybe that's too easy) has little to do with the other person in the relationship. You're falling in love with the dream of love, with the cheap threads of affection for affection that hold you to the other person. And somebody's done the work sewing that mermaid together, and they're looking to make a buck off of you.

That's a pretty dark message for a Sunday afternoon, huh? But it's a dark message well stated. And who says there isn't something cheering in the enlightenment that comes from of a hard truth? I was walking to work the other day and saw a very anxious man standing at an intersection, stepping into and out of the busy street to see whether he could make it across to the other side. Can I go now? Can I go now? All he needed to do was wait until the walk sign told him it was safe to cross, but instead he decided to worry and fret and increase his own anxiety. Right then a line of poetry came to me: "Rejoice in the Law." There is some joy in the hard truths, the red hand that signals "Don't": they can free you. So maybe Clauser's poem isn't the worst thing for a Sunday afternoon.

There's more from &lt;a href="http://www.pw.org/content/grant_clauser" target="blank"&gt;Grant Clauser&lt;/a&gt; and many others in the July/August issue of &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/" target="_blank"&gt;The American Poetry Review&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out. Until tomorrow, friends.</content>

  <title type='text'>Weekly Wrap-Up (July 13 - 19, 2014)</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;This is going to be the first of my Weekly Wrap-Ups. I have a few other ideas I'm going to be putting in place soon, including some themed days like Motivation Mondays and Translation Thursdays. I'd love to hear any readers' ideas or suggestions for things you'd like to see more or less of here on the blog. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wrote my first book review for the blog, a review of Richard Blanco's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/For-All-One-Today-Inaugural/dp/0807033804"&gt;For All of Us, One Today&lt;/a&gt; (parts &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/for-all-of-us-one-today-inaugural-poets.html"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/for-all-of-us-one-today-inaugural-poets_16.html"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). Admittedly it wasn't a proper book of poems, and my upcoming review of Christian Wiman's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Bright-Abyss-Meditation-Believer/dp/0374534373"&gt;My Bright Abyss&lt;/a&gt; won't be either. I guess I'm interested in what makes poets write, how they write, what makes them write the way they do. One of my favorite things online is &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/how-i-work"&gt;Lifehacker's 'This Is How I Work' series&lt;/a&gt;; I'd love to organize a series like this for poets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I read some really interesting and meditative poems by W.S. Merwin (&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/drinking-tea-in-small-hours-by-ws-merwin.html"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/under-tree-of-idleness-by-ws-merwin.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), a nostalgic poem by &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/horse-fantasies-by-alice-derry.html"&gt;Alice Derry&lt;/a&gt;, and a gorgeous poem by &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/aurora-perpetua-by-campbell-mcgrath.html"&gt;Campbell McGrath&lt;/a&gt;. (McGrath, by the way, was one of Richard Blanco's teachers, which is an interesting connection.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also participated in &lt;a href="timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/take-your-poet-to-work-day.html"&gt;Take Your Poet to Work Day&lt;/a&gt;; organizer tweetspeakpoetry did &lt;a href="http://www.tweetspeakpoetry.com/2014/07/17/take-poet-work/"&gt;a great post about the day's success&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We've almost made it to the one-month mark! I'm looking forward to many more months to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Under the Tree of Idleness' by W.S. Merwin</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today I'm reading another poem by W.S. Merwin from the July/August issue of &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/" target="blank"&gt;The American Poetry Review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/drinking-tea-in-small-hours-by-ws-merwin.html" target="blank"&gt;Yesterday &lt;/a&gt;I was talking about how I've learned (a little bit) how to appreciate Merwin's punctuation-less poems. The poem I looked at &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/drinking-tea-in-small-hours-by-ws-merwin.html" target="blank"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, 'Drinking Tea in the Small Hours', was very meditative, very concentrated on a single moment's images and sounds and tastes, but today's poem has a bit of a fairy tale plot to it. So here's 'Under the Tree of Idleness':&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;blockquote&gt;This is where I was going the whole time&lt;br/&gt;when they thought I was lost and were looking&lt;br/&gt;for me everywhere I was right here&lt;br/&gt;but as long as they were looking for me&lt;br/&gt;they walked past and never laid eyes on me&lt;br/&gt;it was only when one stumbled on me&lt;br/&gt;by accident that I seemed to have been&lt;br/&gt;found for a moment before I was gone&lt;br/&gt;again following shadows on the leaves&lt;br/&gt;of the oldest limb where they might never&lt;br/&gt;have been noticed but I watched them as though&lt;br/&gt;I was remembering after a long&lt;br/&gt;time without seeing them although that had been&lt;br/&gt;no time in the life of the tree where I &lt;br/&gt;had heard far away a voice calling to &lt;br/&gt;someone and asking what are you doing&lt;br/&gt;until I answered to call it nothing&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This poem has so much going on, so many knots that need to be untied. Who are "they"? His parents? (That would make it *so* much like the story of &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202%3A41-52" target="blank"&gt;Jesus in the temple as a child&lt;/a&gt;.) His friends? Everybody? And how is it that they can never find him until they stop looking for him? That's such a fairy tale detail, like Alice in the sheep's shop in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_looking_glass" target="blank"&gt;Through the Looking Glass&lt;/a&gt;: "The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things -- but the oddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf, to make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always quite empty: though the others round it were crowded as full as they could hold." It's a dream detail, like how you can't read in a dream.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;(Which makes me think: "Why do I assume that the poetic I is a person at all?" Maybe the "I" is the meaning of the poem, or the Meaning of Poems in general, or Meaning in general. You never find it if you look for it; you only ever stumble upon it "by accident" after you've given up the search. And when you do find it it's not found forever: "I seemed to have been / found for a moment before I was gone / again".) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the really abstract part is in those last few lines. "I / had heard far away a voice calling to / someone and asking what you doing / until I answered to call it nothing". Why does the "I" think that it's being addressed at all? It sounds like someone is calling to someone else, and the "I" interrupts, calling "it"&amp;#8212;the thing that "someone" is doing&amp;#8212;"nothing". We saw this same strategy of crossed communication in Devin Johnston's &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/06/telephone-by-devin-johnston.html" target="blank"&gt;'Telephone'&lt;/a&gt;. What is it doing here?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm surprised that I find this poem satisfying. It's still mysterious to me, but it's a pleasant mystery. I like trying different interpretations out, seeing how each one fits or doesn't fit, playing with what each interpretation might imply if it were true. That's part of the joy of poetry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's the last of Merwin's poems I'm going to be reading in a little while. Please do consider purchasing a copy of &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/" target="blank"&gt;The American Poetry Review&lt;/a&gt; online or in your local bookstore. Read poetry, yes, but also be sure to share poetry and talk about poetry and &lt;a href="http://toddswift.blogspot.com/2014/06/wanted-poetry-buyers.html" target="blank"&gt;buy poetry&lt;/a&gt;. You vote every day with your voice and your dollars.

Photo credit: Matt Valentine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;For the longest time I haven't really understood W.S. Merwin. His translation of Neruda's *Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair *has always been one of my favorites, but his own poems—eschewing punctuation, often falling into anticlimax—have left me unsatisfied.
And I've found that lack of connection aggravating, because in &lt;a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2692/the-art-of-poetry-no-38-w-s-merwin" target="blank"&gt;his interview in the Paris Review&lt;/a&gt; he says so much that I agree with. He seems like a kindred spirit, but I just don't *get* him.
But there are nine new poems in the July/August issue of &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/" target="blank"&gt;The American Poetry Review&lt;/a&gt;, and with some of these I finally feel a connection. And I'm sure it has nothing to do with the previous poems not being good enough or not my style. It just took an encounter with Merwin at a new time in my life, in a new place, for me to see a little more than I had before. Here's one of the nine poems, this one entitled 'Drinking Tea in the Small Hours':
&lt;blockquote&gt;An unlabeled green from Korea
second pick from the foothills of summer
taste of distance and slight rustling of leaves
on old trees with names hard to remember
as I listen after heavy rain in the night
the taste is a hush from far away
at the very moment when I sip it
trying to make it last in the knowledge
that I will forget it in the next breath
that it will be lost when I hear the cock crow
any time now across the dark valley &lt;/blockquote&gt;The trick for me is to *&lt;b&gt;read slowly and read aloud&lt;/b&gt;*. Merwin's omission of punctuation puts the task on the reader to find the pauses that work for her or him. From the context, I feel like you have to put a longish pause after the word "remember", and another after "from far away". But who knows, I could be wrong. Not having punctuation used to bother me, but now I really enjoy that Merwin's given me that freedom as a reader.
There's so much to love in this poem. The simple romance of 'unlabeled green', the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia" target="blank"&gt;synesthetic &lt;/a&gt;quality of lines like 'the taste is a hush from far away', and the cock crowing in the dark (which reminds me both of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial_of_Peter" target="blank"&gt;Peter's denial of Jesus&lt;/a&gt; and Devin Johnston's &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/06/orpingtons-by-devin-johnston.html" target="blank"&gt;'Orpingtons'&lt;/a&gt;). It's a very sensual poem built of simple language with no frills or fuss.
I highly recommend you buy yourself a copy of &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/" target="blank"&gt;The American Poetry Review&lt;/a&gt; online or at your local bookstore. The latest issue includes eight more poems by Merwin, the poem &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/poem/pardon-my-heart" target="blank"&gt;'Pardon My Heart'&lt;/a&gt; by Marcus Jackson which I talked about &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/pardon-my-heart-by-marcus-jackson.html" target="blank"&gt;in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, and a lot of other great stuff that I'll be looking at in the next couple days.
Have a great day, all. Take some time to read a poem or two. Until tomorrow, friends.

  <title type='text'>For All of Us, One Today: An Inaugural Poet's Journey (part 2)</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/for-all-of-us-one-today-inaugural-poets.html" target="blank"&gt;Yesterday &lt;/a&gt;I started looking at Richard Blanco's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/For-All-One-Today-Inaugural/dp/0807033804" target="blank"&gt;*For All of Us, One Today: An Inaugural Poet's Journey*&lt;/a&gt;, which tells the story of how Blanco came to write the poem for President Obama's second inauguration ceremony. I vented a lot of my negative criticisms about the book, some of them fair and some of them not. But today I want to talk about a few passages in the book that I really thought were excellent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I griped yesterday that Blanco says *so many* thank yous throughout the book. But it's a good lesson: we should be grateful and we should show it. Our family, our teachers (including, in Blanco's case, the amazing &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/aurora-perpetua-by-campbell-mcgrath.html" target="blank"&gt;Campbell McGrath&lt;/a&gt;), our friends, our coworkers, our fellow citizens. Everybody deserves a good thank you. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One think I love about the book is that, despite the success Blanco had already found as a poet, he still honestly struggles with form. The book includes the two poems he didn't use&amp;#8212;"What We Know of Country" and "Mother Country". Blanco explains step by step how he wrote them, where they came from (historically, psychologically, etc.), and *why he couldn't use them*. I really admire that kind of attention to voice and craft, that acceptance that &lt;b&gt;a poem can perform a function&lt;/b&gt;, and that some poems are more fit for certain functions than others. By accepting the challenge to write the inaugural poem, Blanco set out on a path of self-discovery: &lt;blockquote&gt;I realized that for years I had subconsciously believed my work had been well received mostly because of my subject matter as a child of exiles, focused on issues of cultural identity, displacement, and a proverbial search for home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But I discovered that it wasn't *what* I wrote about but *how* I wrote about it that made my poems *my* poems, namely, the density of imagery and lushness of language that are signatures of my work. Once that clicked, I knew the task at hand was to revise "One Today" along those lines, not by virtue of altering the subject matter but by infusing it with those same qualities and breathing my voice into it. And&amp;#8212;as Sandra Cisneros advised&amp;#8212;it was important that I approach the poem with the same loving tone as if I *were* speaking about (or to) my mother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/For-All-One-Today-Inaugural/dp/0807033804" target="blank"&gt;*For All of Us, One Today: An Inaugural Poet's Journey*&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Blanco, Beacon Press, 2013, pp. 56-7&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;There are a lot of really good reasons to take on challenges, including creating a better future for yourself. But challenges can also help you see things about your past that you might otherwise have missed. Blanco learned about the impulse that drove his *old* poetry by trying to write a *new* kind of poetry. It's a mark of really admirable emotional and artistic maturity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And about voice. It's really interesting to watch the poems develop from these more personal reflections in "What We Know of Country" and "Mother Country" to the kind of sweeping, inclusive, prophetic voice of "One Today". Here's a relevant passage: &lt;blockquote&gt;Finally I grasped the underlying tension I had been searching for in the poem: namely, the wishing for, the striving for the ideal of being or becoming one, not just for a day, but every day. I came to understand the poem as a kind of prayer, an invocation, with an appeal to our higher selves at its emotional center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/For-All-One-Today-Inaugural/dp/0807033804" target="blank"&gt;*For All of Us, One Today: An Inaugural Poet's Journey*&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Blanco, Beacon Press, 2013, p. 64&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It's good to know there are people who still believe that &lt;b&gt;poetry can bring people together&lt;/b&gt;. Nobody doubts that oratory can or that song lyrics can, but poetry is sometimes pushed to the side. Blanco gives poetry a place in the world of politics, not politics as a struggle for power but politics as a form of communication and peacemaking. Blanco uses poetry &lt;b&gt;*to enact and embody peace*&lt;/b&gt;. It's a powerful example. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alright friends, I've rambled on just about enough. I'd love to discuss Blanco's book with you if you feel like commenting. I think I'll condense all of this down into a review for Amazon and Goodreads. I don't get many commenters here but I know from experience that Amazonians *love* to hate on each other. Fun stuff. But I'll be back looking at more poems tomorrow. Until then!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>For All of Us, One Today: An Inaugural Poet's Journey (part 1)</title>
  <content type='html'>This will be my first book review here on *Tim Reads Poetry*. I want to keep it quick and conversational like my other posts, so I'm going to break my review into two parts over two days.
&lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/richard-blanco" target="blank"&gt;Richard Blanco&lt;/a&gt;, if you aren't familiar, is the poet who read at President Obama's second inauguration. I enjoyed the inaugural poem, which is entitled "One Today". *For All of Us, One Today: An Inaugural Poet's Journey* is Blanco's story of how he came to write the poem. It starts with his Cuban ancestry, passes through his poetic training and the tense weeks leading up to the inauguration, and culminates in the reading of the poem itself. One of the best parts about the book is that includes the text of "One Today" and three other excellent poems.
Today I want to spill out a lot of my cynicism about *For All of Us, One Today: An Inaugural Poet's Journey*. I'm going to get it all out of my system, because this book does have valuable things to say but they're hard to find amidst all the fluff. Tomorrow I'll focus more on the positive aspects of the book.
Blanco seems a bit starstruck -- by himself. A lot of the book reads like an Oscar acceptance speech, a *long* list of thank yous. (Which is very sweet, but, ummm, *why should I care?*) There's a quote from Billy Collins on the back cover: "The high drama here is the backstage look into the pressure and process of writing the poem itself and the thrill of reading it to the world." Not quite, Billy. The book is shaped as follows:

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blanco was an engineer and started writing poetry. He was afraid his engineering buddies wouldn't like his poems, &lt;b&gt;but they did!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blanco enrolled in an MFA program focusing on poetry. He was afraid his classmates wouldn't like his poems, &lt;b&gt;but they did!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blanco was asked to write the poem for the second inaugural. He was afraid Americans wouldn't like his poem, &lt;b&gt;but they did!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So Blanco passes test after test. "Do regular people like me?" Yes! "Do celebrities like me?" Yes! The real "high drama" comes from this one question, which hovers over the entire book: "&lt;b&gt;*Does President Obama like me?*&lt;/b&gt;"
Aaaaand of course he does. "... in May [*after the inauguration*] I'll meet President Obama in the Oval Office and we will speak about his and the First Lady's ongoing commitment to poetry. I will present the president with Sergio's beautiful broadside of 'One Today,' which he'll hang in his back office where he'll say he keeps those things closest to him."
But you know what? I need to give the guy a break. Blanco has attained just about the ultimate in bragging rights as far as poets are concerned, so let him brag. He's now up there with names like Robert Frost and Maya Angelou. He's part of American history. He's got this moment to stand up and talk about what he wants to talk about, so let him have it. If he wants to point out how happy he is with himself and say a few heartfelt thank yous along the way, even if that's boring reading, then let him. And it is boring reading, no mistake, and sometimes embarrassingly sentimental, especially the twentieth time he refers to himself as the "inaugural poet".
I'm reading *My Bright Abyss* right now and the contrast of Blanco's ecstatic enthusiasm and Christian Wiman's dark night of the soul is almost laughable. But maybe that's my real problem with this book: Blanco doesn't have an ounce of melancholy. He's pure cheer. I just don't understand that personality. I don't understand *how* a person can *be* like that. My distaste for it says more about me than it does about Blanco, perhaps. A sunnier disposition might read Blanco and feel right at home. I need to put myself in that person's shoes for a minute or two and see what there is to see. So that's what I'm gonna do, starting tomorrow. (UPDATE: &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/for-all-of-us-one-today-inaugural-poets_16.html"&gt;Part 2 has now been published&lt;/a&gt;.) </content>

  <title type='text'>'Horse Fantasies' by Alice Derry</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today I'm reading 'Horse Fantasies' by &lt;a href="http://alicederry.com/" target="blank"&gt;Alice Derry&lt;/a&gt;, from the Spring issue of &lt;a href="http://www.pshares.org" target="blank"&gt;*Ploughshares*&lt;/a&gt;. This will be the last item I read from the most recent *Ploughshares*. Maybe I'll write something tomorrow about how I choose which poems I read and why I choose so few poems from each journal. There are so many poems I skip over: at one point I would have thought that this means I don't love poetry *enough*, but now I think it's a sign of how *seriously* I take poetry. Not seriously in a straight-faced way. That's not what I mean. What I mean is that &lt;b&gt;*our preferences reveal us to ourselves*&lt;/b&gt;. Aesthetic preference is a form of self-knowledge. We learn more about who we are in a given moment by what we like and dislike in that moment. And self-knowledge is a serious thing, an important thing, an important step toward happiness. Oy vey. Let's get to some poetry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Horse Fantasies' is (in my opinion) about envy and projection and the formation of the imagination. The speaker is a woman looking back on her childhood as an indoorsy girl living in Montana. She does well at school and probably has a boringly happy home life. The object of her attention is 'Terry Jo, the last child / and only daughter of a rancher / whose spread lay deep / in the sheepland steppe, forty miles / south of our little town.' There's something romantic about Terry Jo's parents. Her father is a hard man. His hardness has driven his sons away. He's a man of the land and yet is 'one of the royalty of our town'. I certainly knew these kind of people growing up in California's Central Valley. During the winter Terry Jo lives with her mother in town. I'm guessing that for a suburban kid in the Midwest in say the 60's or 70's, a wife who lives apart from her husband for a portion of the year has got to seem like a pretty unusual thing. It unsettles (for the better, in my humble O) so much of what a child thinks they know about family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I'm not even talking about the most important part yet. Terry Jo rides horses. Her father 'taught her horseflesh, the saddle merely / an extension of four-legged motion.' This is what sticks out to the speaker about Terry Jo. The poem's first line: 'for all the horses I didn't get to ride'. Terry Jo is what the speaker didn't get to be. Is there anybody who doesn't carry with them a memory of that one kid in school who got to do all the cool things we wanted to do but couldn't? (Unless of course *you were that kid*, in which case you can get lost, you jerk.) Either we weren't allowed to or our parents didn't have the money to or we just never knew how to follow our dreams. And they were a kid's dreams. "Riding horses? So what? I should be over this by now." But that memory persists, that envy persists, and we pore out a lifetime of frustrated desires into that memory, so that we never forget our Terry Jo, the girl who was everything we weren't.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And so we deify her. She becomes a touchstone for our childhood, for the place where we grew up. She becomes unreal. The last lines: 'I spoke the language of those ragged plains / as well as she who learned to sweep along them, / wind's love and not its resistance.' The place itself loved Terry Jo as it only could in a child's imagination. This poem reminds me so much of Wordsworth's *Prelude*; for me that's just about the highest praise you can offer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such an interesting poem. I could go on and on about it, but I've gotta rein it in. (Horse metaphors!) If you're interested in this poem by &lt;a href="http://alicederry.com/" target="blank"&gt;Alice Derry&lt;/a&gt; be sure to get a copy of the Spring issue of &lt;a href="http://www.pshares.org" target="blank"&gt;*Ploughshares*&lt;/a&gt;. Keep reading poets. Keep talking about poets. Keep supporting poets. Until tomorrow, y'all.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Aurora Perpetua' by Campbell McGrath</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today I'm reading 'Aurora Perpetua' by &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/campbell-mcgrath" target="blank"&gt;Campbell McGrath&lt;/a&gt;, from the Spring 2014 issue of &lt;a href="https://www.pshares.org/"&gt;Ploughshares&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This poem is too gorgeous not to share. If I'm asked to take it down, I will, but here's the full poem in all its twelve-line glory. I'll encourage you up front to go and &lt;a href="https://www.pshares.org/subscriptions/subscribenow.cfm" target="blank"&gt;buy Ploughshares&lt;/a&gt; online or in stores to help support poets and journals of such high quality. OK, here's 'Aurora Perpetua':&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;O tulip, tulip, you bloom all day and later sway&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a deep-waisted limbo above the dinner table,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;waiting for a coin to drop into your well,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for the stars to pin your stem to their lapel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Soon, on ocean winds, dawn cries its devotion,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;our world entranced once more into being.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Let go your sumptuous rage, darling.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;All this awed awakening is a form of adoration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What's born in that fountain of salt and spume,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of spackled sea monsters and gardenia perfume,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;is everything blossoming ever amounts to:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;an hour of earthly nectar, a single drop of dew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-- Campbell McGrath, *Ploughshares*, Vol. 40, no. 1, Spring 2014, p.152, © 2014 by Emerson College &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of me is skeptical of such a perfectly musical poem. 'Is the *prettiness* of it covering up nonsense? Is there really any *thought* in this poem?' But I think *there is* thought. The individual tulip, representative of the fleeting moment of beauty, the small triumph, is being shown its source in the great 'fountain of salt and spume'. The tulip wants to be exalted; the momentary wants to become eternal. But it needs to be reminded that the eternal is its source; it is a drop of the eternal, made of the same stuff as the eternal, consubstantial with it. No need then, tulip, to wait 'for the stars to pin your stem to their lapel.' In other words, &lt;b&gt;*you don't need to be taken up to perfection, because you are the scion of perfection*&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;'Let go your sumptuous rage, darling.' How many of us are waiting for something to take us up and make us great? How many of us secretly despise, from time to time, the smallness of our lives? 'Let go your sumptuous rage, darling.' How many of us erase little poems we've written, throw first attempts at writing a novel in the trash because we're unhappy with them? How many of us don't bother to be patient or kind or gentle because, you know, what difference does that make in the big scheme of things? 'Let go your sumptuous rage, darling.' Don't pity yourself and indulge your sumptuous rage and wait until morning for another opportunity; the morning is always already arriving.&lt;/p&gt; </content>

  <title type='text'>Our First Anniversary</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today my wife and I are celebrating our first wedding anniversary. Here's a bit of poetry from the Bible that was read at our wedding. This is from Song of Songs 8: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Put me like a seal over your heart,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Like a seal on your arm.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For love is as strong as death, &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Jealousy is as severe as Sheol; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Its flashes are flashes of fire, &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The very flame of the Lord. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Many waters cannot quench love, &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Nor will rivers overflow it; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If a man were to give all the riches &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of his house for love, &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It would be utterly despised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here's some of Psalm 96:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sing to the Lord a new song;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;sing to the Lord, all the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sing to the Lord, praise his name;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;proclaim his salvation day after day.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;let the sea resound, and all that is in it.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;let all the trees of the forest sing for joy.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Let all creation rejoice before the Lord, for he comes,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;he comes to judge the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a great day, everybody!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Thank You!</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I've been running this blog for two weeks and two days now and I couldn't be happier with it. I've written twenty-three posts including this one, and it's been so rewarding just to read and write about poetry each day; I've been in touch with one of the featured poets, which was a really lovely and encouraging experience; and the site has had over 300 views, which is so many more than I would have thought possible for a fledgling blog about a subject as inherently anti-trendy as poetry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, thank you! Thank you for &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html" target="blank"&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you for &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/timothyjellison" target="blank"&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you for posting links on Facebook and clicking that Google +1 at the bottom of the article. Don't be shy about leaving comments or &lt;a href="mailto:timothyellison85@gmail.com"&gt;emailing me&lt;/a&gt; if you want to talk about a specific poem or poet or poetry in general or the website or life or Life with a capital L. I post all my blog entries &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.tumblr.com/" target="blank"&gt;on Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, too, in case you prefer reading over there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Really -- thank you. I hope you stick around and keep discovering new poetry with me each day. It's gonna be fun.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'To One Waiting to be Born' by Malachi Black</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today I'm reading 'To One Waiting to be Born' by &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/malachi-black" target="blank"&gt;Malachi Black&lt;/a&gt;, from the Spring issue of &lt;a href="https://www.pshares.org/index.cfm" target="blank"&gt;*Ploughshares*&lt;/a&gt;. The poem is in three sections or movements, each about fifteen lines long, in blank verse. The poem is directly addressed to one waiting to be born, a sort of song of consolation and instruction and benediction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first few lines of a poem are so important. They set the rhythm and the key, if I can borrow a musical phrase without seeming pretentious. (You're thinking, 'No, you can't.') I love Black's first lines in this poem: 'Know your origin: you are a token / of the afterwards of love.' That's a beautiful thing to say to a child, but isn't it also a great thing to remember as an adult? But it plunges from romance to an apology for how cruel the world will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Good luck; you won't be born as much&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;as you'll be given up. And as you tumble&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;from your orbit toward this crib of sticks&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and dust, be adamant. Be tough. All earth&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;is but a roughness underfoot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything falls apart, including the body. 'You will spoil like a plum.' The solution? 'Be wild: be stranger / and more formless than a boy.' And in the last lines: 'drift as a bright curl in the bluish light / of sky: impervious, indifferent, unhuman.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doesn't that take such a strange turn by the end? (I think that final benediction reads a lot like &lt;a href="http://www.phys.unm.edu/~tw/fas/yits/archive/ammons_mansion.html"&gt;'Mansion' by A.R. Ammons&lt;/a&gt;, for whatever that's worth.) The speaker is basically saying: 'you would be better off if you hadn't been born, or at least not born human.' Who hasn't felt that in moments of trial and hardship? Who hasn't felt, consciously or not, a certain jealousy of the wind and the mountains and the seas which get to be part of this world without all the burdens of life and death? It's ultimately very life-affirming, I think, as it grounds us in our humanity, but it gets there through such a strange and sobering road. Really great companion pieces for comparison would be Yeats' &lt;a href="http://poetry.about.com/od/poems/l/blyeatssonprayer.htm"&gt;'A Prayer for my Son'&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/prayer-my-daughter"&gt;'A Prayer for my Daughter'&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be sure to pick up a copy of &lt;a href="https://www.pshares.org/index.cfm" target="blank"&gt;*Ploughshares*&lt;/a&gt; in stores or online. Read poetry, talk about poetry, support poetry, eat too much poetry and choke on poetry, get in a big fight with poetry and then kiss and make up with poetry. It'll be worth it. Have a happy Friday!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Serial Seeing' by Elaine Equi</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today I'm reading 'Serial Seeing' by Elaine Equi, from the &lt;a href="http://www.colum.edu/columbiapoetryreview/contact.php" target="blank"&gt;*Columbia Poetry Review*&lt;/a&gt; no. 27. I've looked at several other poems by Equi already (&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/cats-now-and-forever-by-elaine-equi.html" target="blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/wolves-of-sacred-heart-by-elaine-equi.html" target="blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/somethings-coming-by-elaine-equi.html" target="blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/it-says-what-we-all-think-by-elaine-equi.html" target="blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Here's 'Serial Seeing':&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A totality&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;claims to be,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;but really--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;how could it&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;contain everything?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gaps&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;let the work&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;breathe,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;let the reader &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in among.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When art is&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;too complete,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;you're locked outside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(a cold business)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;with nothing left&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;to do but admire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-- Elaine Equi, Columbia Poetry Review no. 27, p.176, &amp;#169; 2014 Columbia College Chicago&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the phrase, "Gaps / let the work / breathe, / let the reader / in among." The grammatical emptiness after the preposition "among" enacts the very principle the poet is talking about. Our minds want to fill in the object of the preposition; the poem draws us in, draws out our inner voice to fill the gap. Lucretius in the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Nature-Things-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140447962/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404996863&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=de+rerum+natura" target="blank"&gt;*De Rerum Natura*&lt;/a&gt; puts forward his theory that the only way motion is possible is if there exists a void, a gap between atoms. If there weren't a gap, nothing would be able to move. In more modern scientific terms, no movement means no heat, absolute zero, "a cold business" indeed. And then you come to that perfect last couplet: "nothing left / to do but admire". Have you ever thought of admiration as an ethical problem? Admiration can be a distance you allow between yourself and the things you supposedly love. You can call it respect or admiration or appreciation, but it can be a way of protecting yourself from wild, warmblooded life and turning it into "a cold business". For me at least, it's important to let literature be a part of your life and let your life be a part of literature. I think that's at least partly what Equi is getting at in this poem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the last of the poems from the *Columbia Poetry Review* that I'll be looking at. It's an annual, so I guess I'll have to wait until next year for more. Tomorrow I'll turn to some of the poems in the most recent issue of &lt;a href="http://www.pshares.org/" target="blank"&gt;*Ploughshares*&lt;/a&gt;. Until then!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Glass Box' by Sandra Simonds</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today I'm reading 'Glass Box' by Sandra Simonds, from the &lt;a href="http://www.colum.edu/columbiapoetryreview/"&gt;*Columbia Poetry Review*&lt;/a&gt; no. 27.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I'm gonna geek out about poetic form for a sec, so feel free to skip ahead. The poem (I think) is in 10 pseudo-&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spenserian_stanza"&gt;Spenserian stanzas&lt;/a&gt;. They have the same shape as a Spenserian, but they are unrhymed, and sometimes a stanza will have have too many or too few lines, and the lines will be indented to imply a sort of rhythm, and even though the stanzas are numbered the contents sometimes spill over from one to the next. Maybe she wasn't going for the Spenserian shape at all, but there's certainly an implied ideal shape which is sometimes adhered to and sometimes cast aside. Which is of course part of the poem's theme. The poet chafes against the form as the individual chafes against society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's a small excerpt, from stanza 9: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We--the workers and also my lover and my husband&lt;br/&gt;as well as the man who rejected me, pulled back&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the curtain to find a wall. Then I wasn't so sure I was being&lt;br/&gt;rejected. My lover texted me "we need to talk,"&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I ran ten miles, cooked a vegetarian lasagna for my husband,&lt;br/&gt;bought a pirate costume for my son.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"The Indian Ocean is in Chicago," my son said.&lt;br/&gt;If I don't correct him, I am a bad mom, bad sister,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;bad daughter, bad philosopher-king. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The web of relations and roles is so complex, all of it -- for 'an ordinary woman or "mom" living at the beginning of the 21st / century' -- defined by sex and knowledge and power (if those are three different things). The speaker, like 21st century society, is distracted; we go from her sex life to encounters with a troll on Twitter to motherhood to scholarly references to Dante and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_Duc_de_Berry"&gt;Tr&amp;#232;s Riches Heures&lt;/a&gt;. In the very last stanza the poet identifies with a figure from the Tr&amp;#232;s Riches Heures' page for February. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Limbourg_brothers_-_Les_tr%C3%A8s_riches_heures_du_Duc_de_Berry_-_Fevrier_%28February%29,_detail_-_WGA13019.jpg" width="75%" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are the lines from the poem:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And on the page representing February, the farm workers&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;are warming themselves inside the cottage and the sheep&lt;br/&gt;huddle together outside, but the thing the viewer most&lt;br/&gt;identifies with is the girl with steamy breath on the far right,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;stumbling back through the snow&lt;br/&gt;and the frozen village in the far distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I find the girl's isolation, her place outside of domestic warmth and village life, quite moving. I've seen this image before and never before noticed what Simonds is pointing out here. Isn't that such an important part of what a poet does? &lt;b&gt;*Poets make us see things we've never seen before*&lt;/b&gt;. There's so much of this poem that I'm not discussing, so much that makes it great, but we like what we like and we do what we can. Until tomorrow, poetry-lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/glass-box-by-sandra-simonds.html" data-text="Reading 'Glass Box' by Sandra Simonds" data-via="timothyjellison"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');&lt;/script&gt;&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Ftimreadspoetry.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F07%2Fglass-box-by-sandra-simonds.html&amp;amp;width&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;share=true&amp;amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>The Poetry Magazine Podcast</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;So I just listened to the &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/features/audio?show=The%20Poetry%20Magazine%20Podcast"&gt;*Poetry Magazine* podcast&lt;/a&gt; for the first time this morning on the way to work. It featured Rosanna Warren and Thomas Sayers Ellis reading their poems and Dorothea Lasky discussing her essay from the latest issue of &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/"&gt;*Poetry*&lt;/a&gt;. Looking through the iTunes store, I see that many have tried poetry podcasts but few have succeeded. A podcast is a really cool idea for poetry, I think, though it exposes how weird most spoken poetry can be. Rosanna Warren and Thomas Sayers Ellis both had this kind of 'preacherly' tone, and I think that's sort of what a lot of us want American poetry to be, a sort of sermon. I'm not crazy about it. To me, a lot of American poetry is visual rather than aural. For spoken poetry I like something a little less stentorian, something you can say in a calm voice without looking like you spent the last couple months working on it. I like long sensuous lines that ease their way through your mind rather than clippy little riddles, and if a poem is going to contain clippy riddles, I like it to be short like a zen koan, not a long chain of riddle after riddle after riddle. I'm so opinionated this afternoon; it's hot out. In any case, I look forward to listening to more. If I listen to an episode and really like the way somebody reads their stuff, I'll write something about it here on the blog.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Alright, gotta scoot. Until tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Pardon My Heart' by Marcus Jackson</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;This morning I'm looking at 'Pardon My Heart' by Marcus Jackson, which appears on the back cover of the most recent issue of &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/"&gt;The American Poetry Review&lt;/a&gt;. This one's &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/poem/pardon-my-heart"&gt;available on the web for free&lt;/a&gt;, so I'm going to put the full text up. But do check out the APR's site and consider &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/currentissue"&gt;buying a copy &lt;/a&gt;of the magazine. At $4.50 for the issue it's a steal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So here's 'Pardon My Heart' by Marcus Jackson:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pardon my heart if it ruins your party.&lt;br/&gt;It’s a large, American heart and has had&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a good deal to drink. It’s a pretty bad &lt;br/&gt;dancer—too much feeling, too little technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It may sing some godless hymns, about ousting &lt;br/&gt;armies of loneliness, about marching&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;victorious to wives and towns beneath &lt;br/&gt;a heart-colored dusk. Pardon my heart&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;if it closes its eyes for hours, &lt;br/&gt;whispering *rapture* over and over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pardon my heart if it laughs too loudly, &lt;br/&gt;or if it tells many of its stories&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;too ardently. Pardon my heart if it rests&lt;br/&gt;an arm across you or your friends’ shoulders—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;touch allows my heart to trust that it’s not&lt;br/&gt;imagining your company’s loveliness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pardon my heart if you have to kick it out. &lt;br/&gt;After you’ve muzzled the music and brightened&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the lights to tidy, my heart will ignore &lt;br/&gt;and keep doing its little two-step, aglow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;in the middle of the room, never &lt;br/&gt;happier to have nowhere else to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-- from &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/poem/pardon-my-heart"&gt;The American Poetry Review, Vol. 43 No. 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the one hand, this poem makes me feel embarrassed for the speaker. The phrase 'pardon my heart' is so angsty, something a teenager would scrawl in a notebook. I imagine someone dramatically throwing a cape across his face, yelling "Look away!" It's a self-contradictory message. But on the other hand I think it's so honest about poetry, all art but especially poetry, about the loneliness of it, the weird compromise of sociability and withdrawal that it requires. I love the image: 'my heart will ignore / and keep doing its little two-step / in the middle of the room'. When you're caught up in the rhythm of a poem you're writing or reading and really *getting* it's such a small thing, just a little shuffle back and forth, but it's yours and that makes it everything. For that little while you're *in it* and nothing else matters. And you know before you go in that it's going to be embarrassing when you come out, but you've got to do it anyway. Why is it this way? I don't know, but it is. So you just have to tell the world: 'pardon my heart'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good stuff. It never ceases to amaze me how many talented artists are out there. Check out &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/"&gt;The American Poetry Review&lt;/a&gt;'s website to see about purchasing this issue, to see more great poems from the latest issue, or to set yourself up with a subscription.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alright, that'll do it for today. Have a good day, everybody!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Why I'm Blogging</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;So every now and then I get into these moods where I examine all my daily routines and ask, "Why am I doing this?" It's a good thing to do, though maybe not quite so often as I do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the time has come. (Yeah, I've been blogging just over one week and already I'm taking stock.) So here are what I consider the main reasons I'm keeping this blog going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want &lt;b&gt;to learn&lt;/b&gt; about contemporary American poetry. There are so many journals out there publishing so much poetry; I want to find the stuff that I like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want &lt;b&gt;to share&lt;/b&gt; what I like. I know that I've definitely typed things like 'best contemporary American poets' into Google and read through the first couple pages of results. That's something I hope to provide here, a link to what I consider the best.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want &lt;b&gt;to write&lt;/b&gt; and really get my writing abilities back in shape. I know the quality of this first couple weeks' worth of posts hasn't been that great. I know I would never submit anything I've published here to a serious forum. But I also know that it's already made me feel more comfortable with writing after the couple years' hiatus I've gone through after leaving grad school. It's a bit of rehabilitation. It's good for me. It's fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, even if I haven't convinced you, I've convinced myself. So the blogging will continue. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Elegy for the Road' by Tatiana Oroño (translated by Jesse Lee Kercheval)</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I picked up a few new journals / magazines to read yesterday. The July/August issue of the &lt;a href="https://www.aprweb.org/"&gt;*American Poetry Review*&lt;/a&gt;, the summer issue of &lt;a href="http://www.threepennyreview.com/index.html"&gt;*The Threepenny Review*&lt;/a&gt;, and the Spring issue of &lt;a href="https://www.pshares.org/index.cfm"&gt;*Ploughshares*&lt;/a&gt;. I look forward to reading through them in the coming weeks. Today's poem is 'Elegy for the Road' by Tatiana Oro&amp;#241;o (translated by Jesse Lee Kercheval), from the Spring issue of *Ploughshares*.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The poem is written in two short prose paragraphs. In the first paragraph, the speaker says "I ask where the things go that did not arrive at their destination" and then rephrases each of this sentence's elements repeatedly. Who is is asking whom? Why isn't this broken into lines as we expect in a poem? Then, in the second paragraph, an answer comes: "Poetry is the place where the things go that have no solution. To look for it."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something this poem got me thinking about that I hadn't before is a certain scene in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Furioso#Plot"&gt;Orlando Furioso &lt;/a&gt;when the knight Astolfo flies to the moon to recover Orlando's wits. The moon is his destination because that's where all lost things go. The connection Oro&amp;#241;o's poem made for me is that the moon itself, in its &lt;b&gt;*fantastic unreachableness*&lt;/b&gt;, is a symbol of poetry, of imagination, of invention. The moon is a place of elegy, a place where lost things live on in name alone. All lost things go to the moon because, for those of us who miss them, *we need them to be somewhere*.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The poem also got me thinking about what it means for a piece of text to be a poem. How can prose be poetry? Is anything we put in the poetry section poetry? As an analysis of poetry itself, Oro&amp;#241;o's poem perhaps shows a relationship between prose thought and poetic invention. Philosophical speculation and poetry are separate activities; philosophy pokes holes in the universe and poetry tries to fill them. Poetry is somewhat philosophical, at least, because it shows where the holes are by filling them. But they aren't the same activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm not too sure I see how the poem's title relates to its content. I've never really cared about titles, except for when it comes to minimizing the anxiety I feel about the titles of my own poems. But usually I like to sense *some* connection between the title and the body. Oh well. So much for the lost title. I should write a poem about it, or see if it's on the moon.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Long, Long Ago I Used to Smoke in Bed' by Diane Seuss</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today I'm reading 'Long, Long Ago I Used to Smoke in Bed' by Diane Seuss, from the Columbia Poetry Review no. 27. (This journal *still* isn't available online anywhere, so you'll have to either explore your local bookstores or contact &lt;a href="http://www.colum.edu/columbiapoetryreview/" target="blank"&gt;CPR&lt;/a&gt; directly to get a copy)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the way this poem unfolds. The speaker lives in the basement of an old Victorian house. She describes her space: she owns nothing, nothing but a red velour chair with a matching ottoman and 'a cardboard box / full of tangled costume jewelry'. She dresses up and hennas her hair for nobody in particular. So far so weird. Then we learn that to make money she transcribes the recorded confessions of a murderer for a local author, and that she has a love/hate with Arthur Rimbaud. And that local girls come by with their boyfriends to visit her, the girls attracted by her strange way of life, the boys upset by losing their girlfriends' attention for even a second. (If this feels really vague then I think that's the point. She talks about it so generally but it seems like there's something very specific behind it. How many of these girls and boys could there really have been?) And then we learn that the upper floors of the Victorian house are haunted by a woman waiting for her fianc&amp;#233;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of Edmund Spencer's *The Faerie Queene*, which is full of contrasting masculine-feminine pairs. No sooner does Spencer create one romantic couple than he feels compelled to create another one to contrast with it, and then another, and another, until his fantasy world is buzzing with varying wavelengths of love and lust. Maybe that informs why I try to read this poem the way I do. The contrasting pairs are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;table border="0"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The poet 'long ago'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;|&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Arthur Rimbaud&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Michigan girls who love her&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;|&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Michigan boys who hate her&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The ghost upstairs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;|&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The ghost's lost fianc&amp;#233;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The poet now&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;|&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;??&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What are they pointing to? What traumatic event ties these all together? Or is that not it at all? Is this a symbolic portrait of a psyche? I don't know, but I love it, love to think about it. Yesterday I looked at a poem that I read very personally, but good poetry can also be *&lt;b&gt;an invitation to think about the unfamiliar&lt;/b&gt;*.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Math Rock Drummer' by Cameron Dezen Hammon</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I picked up the *Columbia Poetry Review* no. 27 at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble pretty much at random about a week and a half ago. Most of it wasn't quite my taste, but it had a few poems that I really enjoyed. Elaine Equi's poems were the highlight for me (&lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/07/somethings-coming-by-elaine-equi.html"&gt;I've discussed one of them already&lt;/a&gt;), but I also really enjoyed 'Long, Long Ago I Used to Smoke in Bed' by Diane Seuss, 'Glass Box' by Sandra Simonds, and (the subject of this post) 'Math Rock Drummer' by Cameron Dezen Hammon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Math Rock Drummer' is a very direct, colloquial poem about (on the surface) a failed relationship. A twenty-four year old 'math rock drummer' courts a nineteen year old girl using his poetry, but when he meets her she proves a disappointment 'in flesh'. But it's just as well from her perspective: he's not nearly as romantic as his poetic persona or musical ability would make you expect. 'In real life he talked like a Baltimore / fisherman, not like Eliot.' And then she sums it up in what are no doubt the best ending lines of this entire issue of *CPR*: 'I knew it would never work // No man could love both me and Pound.'&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm about to take this in a personal direction because this poem really spoke to me about my own story, but before I do I'll say something more generally about the poem. I love how quickly the poem moves. Hammon's short phrases and conversational tone let her include real humor, the kind of self-confident everyday humor you won't find in many other poems. Which is great because it's also a poem about positioning oneself artistically, about stating one's artistic alliances and what it means to live those alliances, the sort of *ars poetica* poem that doesn't usually include humor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So now for the personal bit. When I was in highschool, playing in a really bad garage band, *who you listened to* was a way of telling the world *who you were*. This would still probably be the case if I hung out with musicians. When I got to grad school, it was all about *who you read*. Some pretty boring personalities could hide themselves in whatever romantic glow surrounded Sebald or Post-war Cinema or the digital humanities. I did the very same thing with Classics and Renaissance Studies. I waved them over my head like a flag. 'This is me! This is me!' When I told people that I was writing something about the Faerie Queene or Catullus, I was saying '*I'm* the sort of guy who venerates old things but also wants to re-invigorate them through bold, new ways of reading.' The problem was that I didn't really want that and I wasn't really that sort of guy. It was just a stance. Worse, I found the company of people who *genuinely* wanted that to be insufferable. There was a disconnect between my literary 'interests' and who I really was. My approach to literature had its roots in my own conservative upbringing in California's Central Valley. I was raised in an electrically self-conflicted combination of liberal Catholicism and small-town provincialism. As long as I wasn't addressing *that*, that beautiful *tension*, I wasn't going to have a healthy relationship with literature or (more importantly) with other people. I needed to admit that I was more 'Baltimore fisherman' than urbane scholar before I could correct my angle of approach toward literature and people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess what I'm trying to get at is that &lt;b&gt;*we can use our literary and artistic interests to hide from ourselves and from others*&lt;/b&gt;. It's something we all have to be careful of. It's something I failed to be aware of for an embarrassingly long time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speaking of embarrassment, I've been talking about myself for a while now. But that's something really good poems can get you to do, right? They show you to yourself and make you reconsider who you are. That's what Cameron Dezen Hammon's 'Math Rock Drummer' did for me.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Hymn to Life' by Timothy Donnelly</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The last poem I'll look at from the July/August 2014 issue of *Poetry Magazine* is &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/247868"&gt;Timothy Donnelly's 'Hymn to Life'&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poem is arranged in sixty six-line stanzas. The lines are of fairly equal length across the page (would you call that typographical length?) but with no stable metrical guidelines that I can see. If you're reading the poem online, you won't see that the sixty stanzas are arranged five to a page for twelve pages. It seems to me that the poem's theme is the &lt;b&gt;*overwhelming abundance*&lt;/b&gt; of life, so the way his poem appears on the page -- nearly filling up the physical page, taking all the space it can -- is relevant to its theme. His use of enjambment is relevant too: there's hardly a phrase or an idea that isn't so full that it must spill over the edge of the line or the stanza. Also significant is his range of register: we move from biology to geology to pop music to the Bible to the writer's home as he's writing the poem. It's all about abundance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is why it's so funny that the first line begins: 'There were no American lions.' Odd for a poem about life to begin with &lt;b&gt;*extinction&lt;/b&gt;*, but it continues to do so, piling up names of the deceased and a few anecdotes of the last time certain species were ever seen. In the insistent march of 'Life' (a sort of &lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/song-myself-iii"&gt;Whitmanian 'procreant urge'&lt;/a&gt;) so much is left behind. 'Life', if it is a god that deserves a hymn, is a bit terrifying. 'Life' isn't Mother Nature so much as an imperious queen who's liable to forget her loyal subjects while she makes new plans.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eighteen stanzas into the poem we get these lines, which explain the theme of the poem about as well as anything could:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;... All these gains and losses, so mysterious&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;from a distance, held together it has felt by nothing stronger&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;than momentum, like a series of bicycle accidents or a pattern&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in the pomegranate, come to hint at a logic in time, but whether&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;it’s more fitting to say that they promise to reveal it or else&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;threaten to is debatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There aren't many long poems that I'm crazy about, but Donnelly's 'Hymn to Life' works on the same wavelength, for me, as the long poems written by two of my favorites: &lt;a href="www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Poems-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140424512"&gt;Whitman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="www.amazon.com/Other-Poems-Lights-Pocket-Poets/dp/0872860175"&gt;Ginsberg&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That finishes up my reading of the latest *Poetry Magazine*. Maybe I should write a little something about why I didn't choose the other poems? Maybe I'll do something like that later. Right now I'm too excited about finding things I like. I'll just say this though: I love poetry more maturely now than I did when I was younger. When I was younger and I didn't like a poem, I passionately disliked it. I berated it. I knew how *good* poetry could be, and it bothered and offended me that *all* poems weren't that good. I was awful. The worst. Now I believe in &lt;b&gt;*pluralism*&lt;/b&gt; in literature. If I don't like a poem, there's probably somebody else who does, and that's ok. That poem simply wasn't made for me. Maybe later I'll be the sort of person that poem was made for, and then I'll be grateful it's there. So in lieu of spilling critical poison in your ear regarding all the things I don't like and why, I'll leave you with a quotation &lt;a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/233.html"&gt;attributed &lt;/a&gt;to Kurt Vonnegut: "Any reviewer who expresses rage and loathing for a novel is preposterous. He or she is like a person who has put on full armor and attacked a hot fudge sundae."&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'It Says What We All Think' by Elaine Equi</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/247882" target="blank"&gt;'It Says What We All Think'&lt;/a&gt; is the last of the Elaine Equi poems I'll be looking at from the July/August 2014 issue of *Poetry Magazine*.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The photo that accompanies 'It Says What We All Think' is of a red-painted wall with the words 'LOVE ME' rolled on in white. It's above street level, though it isn't clear how high. The poem hints that it can be found 'Getting off the subway at Canal St.' Mere Bostonian that I am, I leave it to the New Yorkers to determine what this location might add to the context. If this were an ancient poem (my background is in Classics) we would interpret it as a liminal space between Lower Manhattan and Midtown and explore the social valences of the location, where it positions the poet socially, how it reveals the Sitz im Leben of the poem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are all good questions to ask, but I think they stay too far away from the poem. The poem is just a marginal note, just a tag. The point of Equi's poem is to bring up an important question about this 'LOVE ME': who is the author? This is the marginal note she adds to this little piece of New York. Imagine New York were divided into a billion photos of New York on Instagram or Facebook, each with its own comment board. Wouldn't Equi's question -- who wrote this? -- be a fitting comment? Her simple and unpretentious diction would fit in perfectly to this context. This is why I interpret these poems as &lt;b&gt;*marginalia*&lt;/b&gt;. They fit alongside life, alongside the world as it is experienced outside of literature. They don't try to transform the world into art; they just use art to make comment or mark an occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of marginalia, here's a marginal note of my own. Something that bothers me in my own writing is the relationship between the title and the poem's body. Equi's first line in the poem is "even if we won't admit it." The line of thought continues from the title, as thought the title were just another line that happened to be bold and in four-points larger font. Wallace Stevens does this with his titles, and it bothers me to no end. In my own writing I think of the title as something incidental. I would rather just have numbers or dates to reference them. But usually I buckle to some sense of pressure and tag each poem with a title that I don't really believe in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, I had better sign off for the day. This is my eighth day of blogging about poetry. It's been fun and it's been difficult, too. I genuinely enjoy the poems I write about, and I genuinely enjoy writing about them. But I don't know if anyone's really reading. The few views Google says I have could just be bots. I know I would read a blog like this, so I have to force myself to believe that other people would too. Gotta just stay true to the work and give it time and patience and let it become what it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Something's Coming' by Elaine Equi</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;OK, I'm itching to get at another Elaine Equi poem, so I'm going to do write this second post today. This post is about 'Something's Coming' from the &lt;a href="http://www.colum.edu/columbiapoetryreview/" target="blank"&gt;*Columbia Poetry Review *&lt;/a&gt;no. 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately *CPR* hasn't updated its website or put the journal for sale online anywhere, so I can't advise on how you can get a copy of this poem unless you've got a really good local bookstore. And alas, because of my respect for copyright law I'm afraid I won't put the poem up here for you. So here's what I'll do: I'll try to describe the poem in such a way that you'll want to do &lt;b&gt;everything in your power&lt;/b&gt; to go out and get a copy for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is, like, the ultimate Boho hipster holiday love poem. It starts with a couple exchanging gifts on their first 'Xmas' together. The speaker receives 'Einstein's theory of relativity, / soap on a rope, *West Side Story*' and gives "a bottle of Stolichnaya'. The next day a neighbor is helping them dig their car out of the snow and remarks that 'he'd never seen / two people so happy / to go to Burger King.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes in three short stanzas. The movement is quick and decisive: you gave --&gt; I gave --&gt; the neighbor said. Done. End of poem. It's got that living unornamented quality to it that the best of William Carlos Williams has. The sentence structures and diction are contemporary, colloquial. The speaker says "Xmas" instead of "Christmas" in the first line, and that letter X carries so much, doesn't it? Two lines meeting, a symbol of union, the Chi of Christ, the ex of a lonely life left behind. (Am I being too imaginative in my reading? I don't care.) And the Burger King kills me. It comes across without a trace of the bathetic. It just feels real and sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sometimes think that poem's chief value can be in how imitable it is. I first thought this when reading &lt;a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/users/m/morillo/public/stella.htm" target="blank"&gt;Jonathan Swift's birthday poems to Stella&lt;/a&gt;. I think now that, if I were to sit down and write a love poem to my wife, I might do it like Elaine Equi has done here. Short and sweet and honest and funny. Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Wolves of the Sacred Heart' by Elaine Equi</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today I'm looking at &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/247884" target="blank"&gt;'Wolves of the Sacred Heart'&lt;/a&gt; by Elaine Equi, part of her photo and poetry collection 'Local Colors' in the July/August 2014 issue of &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/toc/2440" target="blank"&gt;*Poetry Magazine*&lt;/a&gt;. And in case you're wondering, I really do enjoy poems that *don't* include animals and I'll look at one tomorrow, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the photo the camera is drawn up close to two pictures in elegant gold-finished antique frames. Just in front of the pictures in their frames are some fake flowers, described in the accompanying poem as "color-coded floral candelabras". I'm guessing they are some kind of cheap plastic or glass, something thin so that when they are turned on the light can shine through their pink and white petals. The real stars of the show, however, are the pictures themselves. The picture on the left is of three wolves in a snowy landscape. The two wolves on the left and right are standing with their bodies at profile, their faces turned toward the viewer as though they were posing for their portrait. The third wolf between them is sort of slinking or stalking toward us, its head angled down just slightly toward the snow. This wolf's body is not in profile, and the difficulties of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_%28graphical%29#Foreshortening" target="blank"&gt;foreshortening&lt;/a&gt; seem to have overwhelmed the artist. The picture on the right is of Jesus dressed in a lush crimson tunic under a blue cape -- like Superman in reverse. In the exact center of his chest is visible the Sacred Heart, bleeding, bound in thorns, radiating some kind of holy light. You can't see his face, but he's doing that classic Jesus-thing with his left hand where he's making a ninety degree angle between his extended thumb and index finger while drawing his middle, ring, and pinky fingers in toward his stigmata-marked palm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equi's poem reads:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Leave it to the street vendors&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of NYC to improvise a shrine&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;from whatever they find,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;setting a place at their table&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for animal and divine nature&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;symbolically joined with&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;color-coded floral candelabras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One principle of composition that I love is &lt;b&gt;*juxtaposition*&lt;/b&gt;. Just put things next to each other and let the reader or viewer infer connections. Here the connections are established on a vendor's table. It's commerce that brings these things together -- religion and nature and fake nature. But "commerce" is a crass way of putting it. The engine of commerce is desire, and desire is the impulse to draw things into oneself. What puts these three items on the table, what unites "animal and divine nature", is the desire to be both animal and divine, incorporate them, embody them. You couldn't choose a more perfect symbol than the Sacred Heart, the ultimate symbol of the union of God and human flesh. (I've read that the beating of the heart is the first source of all music and poetry. Is that relevant? Do I care?) You also couldn't choose a more perfect symbol than those fake flowers, those painted wolves. We love things that live. We love to love things that live. That's how they all get onto the same table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll read one more Equi poem from *Poetry Magazine* tomorrow, then I'm going to look at some of her stuff in the latest *Columbia Poetry Review*. Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Cats, Now and Forever' by Elaine Equi</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today I'm looking at &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/247888" target="blank"&gt;'Cats, Now and Forever'&lt;/a&gt; from Elaine Equi's collection of photographs and poems called 'Local Colors', printed in the July/August 2014 issue of &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/" target="blank"&gt;*Poetry Magazine*&lt;/a&gt;. In the photo there are two ceramic figurines, I'm guessing six inches tall at most, on a dark wicker shelf, probably in a store full of old knick-knacks. They are anthropomorphic cats in Victorian or conservative early 20th century dress, glossy and colorful. One of the cats is reading a book entitled *Lady Catterly's Lover*. She is shocked at what she reads: the one hand that is not holding the book is raised to her mouth, as though she is gasping. The other cat is also reading, though from the angle of the photograph we can't tell what. *A Tale of Two Kitties*? Below the photograph, Equi appends these two prosey lines of verse:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;An arty feline couple parodies bourgeois gender roles&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and literary values before the days of YouTube.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The one cat's shocked reaction to D.H. Lawrence dates it as an expression of a certain attitude toward books and sex. But no that's not it at all: it dates it as a parody of that Victorian attitude. It doesn't show a world shocked at sex; it shows a world amused that there had been a world (a childish, kittyish world) that was shocked at sex. It's a little remarkable that someone chose to express that sense of amusement at the preceding generation's naiveté into (of all things) a couple of cat figurines. Yet I can't help but think that whoever buys these figurines will buy them not for the quality as social commentary but because they think the kitties are cute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The poem, for me, brings out two things. First, it reminds me that one form of poetry is *&lt;b&gt;marginalia&lt;/b&gt;*. Poetry can be the clever comment or memorandum written off to the side of life. Equi's verses give us her take on this little piece of New York that who knows how many thousands have passed by in silence. There is nothing so kitsch or banal or abstract that it can't be made the subject of a poem. This sort of attitude is eye-opening, not just for poets but for people moving about their everyday world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Second, I'm interested in the way we use animals to talk about ourselves. As in my look at &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.blogspot.com/2014/06/scavenger-by-devin-johnston.html" target="blank"&gt;Devin Johnston's 'Scavenger'&lt;/a&gt;, I feel tempted when I read an animal poem to anthropomorphize, allegorize, moralize. It's very hard to see another living thing and not invest it with one's own mode of consciousness. Why? Is this a hangover from reading too much Aesop? Watching too many Disney cartoons? These cat figurines, like the YouTube videos Equi mentions, buy wholly into the representative quality of animals. Animals are 'cute', 'adorable'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel like I'm missing the point. There's a point here and I don't see it yet; at least I know that I'm not seeing it. Maybe it will come to me as I look more closely at the other photographs in the series. That will have to wait for tomorrow, unfortunately. Elaine Equi also has some poems in the *Columbia Poetry Review* so I'll look at those afterward, too. Until tomorrow, then!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Orpingtons' by Devin Johnston</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today I'm reading &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/247844" target="blank"&gt;'Orpingtons' by Devin Johnston&lt;/a&gt;, from the July/August 2014 issue of &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/" target="blank"&gt;*Poetry Magazine*&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a lovely picture of an Orpington very like the ones Johnston describes in the poem: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Orpington_chicken_2.jpg" width="75%"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two Orpingtons in the poem are dark colored: one is black, the other a deep blue. It is late, nearly the full dark of night. I don't think it says in the poem, but the night must be warm, perhaps cooled slightly by a last evening breeze. The poem ends quietly as it began, three of the most beautiful lines I've read in some time: "the days grow long enough / to kindle in each a yolk, / the smallest flame of spring."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All poems don't really need commentary, do they? Can't it be enough to just say, "Read this"? Perhaps. But in my experience it's precisely the poems that *least* conspicuously employ symbol and gesture that require the *most* clarification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or rather let's say this: *&lt;b&gt;it is right to talk about the things we love&lt;/b&gt;*. Yes, that feels true to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"They settle down to roost, / two rests upon a stave." This is the critical pair of lines for me, the only time the poem draws slightly away from the closely observed subject toward something, I don't know, aesthetic. The two Orpingtons are compared to musical notation, but not the sound of two notes but the sound of rest. They are pauses, they are living quietnesses. And this quietness, through the last three lines -- "the days grow long enough / to kindle in each a yolk, / the smallest flame of spring" --, is tied to regeneration, creation, slow and organic growth of new life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's the last of Devin Johnston's poems I'm going to talk about in a while. Tomorrow I'll look at Elaine Equi's photographs from the same issue of *Poetry Magazine*, then hopefully I can talk about some poets from the new *Columbia Poetry Review* before returning to *Poetry* to talk about Timothy Donnelly's 'Hymn to Life'. Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Scavenger' by Devin Johnston</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today I'm looking at &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/247846" targer="blank"&gt;'Scavenger' by Devin Johnston&lt;/a&gt;, from the July/August 2014 issue of &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/" target="blank"&gt;Poetry Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. This one is a straightforward nature poem, I think. The poet observes a buff-banded rail picking at the scraps around the feet of some picnickers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The buff-banded rail is a scavenger native to Australia and the South Pacific. Here's a pic:&lt;img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Buff-banded_Rail_Fafa_Island.jpg" width="75%"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Johnston's choice of vocabulary makes me want to anthropomorphize the rail so that I can draw a moral from it. The rail 'queries' its food, its manners are 'so refined / as to be indeterminate', its 'herringbone' is 'immaculate', it is 'aloof though underfoot', it shows 'no trace / of table-scrap solicitude / for any human hand or face'. It strikes me as descriptive of a certain kind of person whose refined manners hardly mask his greed. This turns the rail into an emblem rather than a bird, a rail and not a rail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That phrase in the second-to-last line, 'table-scrap solicitude', reminds me of the story of &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+16:19-31&amp;version=NIV" target="blank"&gt;the rich man and Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; in the Gospel of Luke. In light of that reference, the picnickers are a sort of council of the gods, and the rail is the rich man who eats their scraps but doesn't acknowledge it with gratitude or any sense of responsibility to share his blessings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I can see already that that's over-reading. There's nothing wrong with over-reading as long as we acknowledge it as such. Over-reading can be a good thing. We readers discover ourselves in what we add to the poem. Contemplating a poem is very like dreaming. It helps coax the subconscious mind to come out and play. For me, I've always got this God and Mammon question churning somewhere in my mind, so I shouldn't be surprised that it came up while I tried to read a poem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But after this kind of over-reading you always have to come back to the buff-banded rail. It is, after all, just a bird. As a picnicker, would I try to shoo it away? Wouldn't that make me the rich man and him Lazarus? Why shouldn't I share with it? What other way do I have to commune with it except by sharing food? Why should I judge it because it *appears* entitled? There is a kind of pitiable spiritual poverty in those who wish to appear dignified without containing the substance of dignity, isn't there? And if that poverty is pitiable, will I express my pity? Will I live it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm over-reaching again. Always back to the rail, back to the rail, back to the rail. It's so hard to look at something not like a mirror. Nobody said this would be easy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Dylan Thomas movie</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I've got a very full and busy day ahead of me, so I'll have to write more about Devin Johnston's new poems in *Poetry Magazine* tomorrow. Until then, here's a some info regarding &lt;a href="http://www.bbcwpressroom.com/bbc-america/press/bbc-america-premiere-poet-new-york-fall-us/" target="blank"&gt;a new movie / miniseries about Dylan Thomas's last days.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hardest part of any new venture is that you *will* stumble early on, and you have to be able to shake yourself off, own your embarrassment, and keep moving. I've always been enamored of beginnings, but I've also always shied away after that first inevitable stumble. There are other obstacles that I know are coming. I'll get to those when I get to those.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>'Telephone' by Devin Johnston</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/247842" target="blank"&gt;'Telephone,' by Devin Johnston&lt;/a&gt;, is an amazing poem in the July/August issue of *Poetry Magazine*. This was the first time I'd read Johnston's work, but now I'm going to make a point of reading all of it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Formally it's a very simple poem. It's built of six-and-a-half six-line stanzas, each line about two to seven syllables long. There's no punctuation but the stops come naturally at the ends of lines and stanzas. No pretension, no experimentation, dignified in its simplicity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The poem opens with a mockingbird perched on a long-abandoned payphone. The phone is ringing in the overgrown hedges -- who's calling whom? from where? -- and the mockingbird mimics the sound. The sound of the ringing spreads first among birds and then among humans, "from Kiowa / to Comanche to Clark". I'm assuming Clark here is William Clark, the American explorer who along with Meriwether Lewis brought so many Native American words into American English. Then someone picks up -- who? when? -- and "a voice / on the other end" says the name of the Kaw people who gave the territory and then state of Kansas its name. "Kansas" has been interpreted (possibly *mis*interpreted) as meaning "people of the wind," which explains something of the last half-stanza: "*Kaw* / which is only the sound / of a word for wind / then only the sound of wind".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's a striking movement of images and thought. The poem *feels* like a nature poem at first, but it becomes historical and then even political by the end. The death of the last mother-tongue Kansa speaker in the 1980s is relevant. That last half-stanza leaves you just sitting there, listening to the silence of what should be three more lines. You should sit in silence for three lines. It's the sound of wind, the sound after the end of all speech. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sadness of it, the unshakable sense of apocalypse that follows the image of the Kaw people, makes us reevaluate the poem from the beginning. The payphone, too, is an outmoded form of speech. If this were Wordsworth the mockingbird would be sitting on a stone ruin or a tree with someone's name carved into it; instead it's sitting on a method of communication whose time is up. Like the Kansa language to William Clark or the French trappers, the ringing of the payphone is just insignificant sound to the mockingbird. But an old system of signification, in its extinction, becomes a signifier in a new system of signification. The sound of a payphone ringing and of the Kansa language are given a new life, such as it is, in songs and place-names.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is the person who picks up the phone the person the message was intended for? I think the answer to this question must be yes because, really, *the message is intended for whoever will listen*. The "voice / on the other end" who picks up must be the sort of person who goes out into the hedges, into the abandoned places, and is willing to engage with whatever is willing to speak. And the speaker speaks, regardless of the listener's contingency. And who is the speaker whose calling? I think we could say it's history, though that word "history" is so vague here. It's the voice of *what-has-been* ringing out like a bell. *Maybe *that gets a little closer to it? It's a trace or remnant of what was, always speaking itself if we are willing to listen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So endeth my interpretation. My thoughts are half-formed. But this is a blog, after all. I know that I don't have adequate answers to certain questions like, What role does the poet play in all this? I know that five years from now my interpretation may be completely different. But just by exploring, attempting, braving questions, and braving answers I feel closer to the poem, closer to the poet, closer to myself as a poet, closer to poetry, centered, more myself, more at home in language, more at home in the universe. That may not be what poetry is for, but it's what poetry does for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jesus, I'm so damned dramatic and sentimental sometimes. I'm always embarrassed by it, but maybe some people like it. Whatevs. Still a couple more Johnston poems in this issue of *Poetry Magazine *to look at. I'll do those tomorrow and Monday. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Highlights from this month's Poetry Magazine</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The July/August issue of *Poetry Magazine* is a good one. The highlights for me (all of which I'll explore more in upcoming posts) are &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/devin-johnston" target="_blank"&gt;Devin Johnston&lt;/a&gt;'s three poems, &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/timothy-donnelly" target="_blank"&gt;Timothy Donnelly&lt;/a&gt;'s 'Hymn to Life,' a set of beautiful art prints by &lt;a href="http://tonyfitzpatrick.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Tony Fitzpatrick&lt;/a&gt;, and a photo series by &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/elaine-equi" target="_blank"&gt;Elaine Equi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The big beast of a poem in this issue is Timothy Donnelly's 'Hymn to Life.' It's like Walt Whitman meets John McPhee, this wild foray into American geology and biology and history but with this interesting six-line stanza structure and (thank you!) a respect for the sentence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Ah, the sentence. So many poems use sentence fragments to get a vatic or gnomic tone that's just so *embarrassing*. If free verse is like playing tennis without the net, writing in sentence fragments is like playing without the ball. That said, I definitely write in fragments too, and when fragment poems are good they're damn good.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;*Poetry* does a great job with prints. The colors from Tony Fitzpatrick's drawings/collages and Elaine Equi's photos really pop. Maybe it's the beautiful heavy paper they print on? Anyway, the production quality is wonderful. Tony Fitzpatrick is an amazing Chicago artist that I hadn't heard of before, but now I want to see everything he's done. And Elaine Equi I had only just recently discovered (I am, as always, several years behind everyone else) through the *Columbia Poetry Review* no. 27, so it was awesome to see more of her work in *Poetry*.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then there are Devin Johnston's three poems. I want to call them bird poems because birds are the key image in all three, but that would be a little reductive. I love their quiet tone, slow and observant and thoughtful. They have an equal dignity on the page and read aloud. Lovely.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>The AIRC Index</title>
  <content type='html'>Last week my wife and I stopped at the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble just around the corner from our apartment here in Boston. Since it's near a university it has a good selection of literary journals, more than your average big-box bookstore. I picked up a copy of *Poetry Magazine*, the July/August issue, along with the annual *Columbia Poetry Review*. I've read them both now and, thinking about my reading experience, I notice that I had one of four reactions to each poem:

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attraction &lt;/b&gt;- I enjoyed the poem, for whatever reason, and I finished it wanting to read more by its author.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Indifference &lt;/b&gt;- I understood the poem, but it just didn't click with me on any level. I was left feeling open to the possibility that its author might, under different circumstances, have written something that I would like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Repulsion &lt;/b&gt;- I understood the poem but found its message, form, or some other aspect objectionable. I was put off reading anything else by its author.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Confusion &lt;/b&gt;- I simply didn't understand the poem. I couldn't see a message or a form in it. Water under the bridge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
It was always more or less one of these four reactions, which gave me an idea. As I read more journals, I'll give each issue a grade based on the percentage of poems that really attracted me divided by the total number of poems. I'm calling it the &lt;b&gt;AIRC &lt;/b&gt;index. Do you love it or hate it? Whatever, I love it so it's staying. The AIRC index for the July/August Poetry Magazine, for example, would be about 30%. Compare that to 11% for the *Columbia Poetry Review*.* *These numbers are extremely subjective, of course, but over time it will give me a solid idea of which journals have editors whose taste is similar to my own.

This is a valuable exercise as a reader *and *as a writer. I've been unsuccessfully submitting poems to journals for about a year now, and one of my big mistakes is that I haven't been reading any of the journals I'm submitting to. If I had blindly submitted material to the *Columbia Poetry Review*, for example, I would never have known that their aesthetic is *very *different from my own. They're a little more Charles Bernstein, I'm a little more Devin Johnston: alas, this union was not meant to be.&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I'll try out this thing out for a little while. If it's a total bust I'll abandon it, but I've got high hopes.</content>

  <title type='text'>Making a Change</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;This blog is a continuation of what I'm doing over on &lt;a href="http://timreadspoetry.tumblr.com"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;. Same content, different url.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s halfway through the year and I’m halfway through my goal of reading 100 books in 2014. Something I’ve reconnected with through this experience is my love of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love to read poetry. I’ll read through hundreds of pages of bad poems just to find one that I like, and I love that search. And I love that once I’ve found that one poem, I can revisit it again and again, learn it by heart, give it a place in my brain. Novels and short fiction, by comparison, almost always feel like a bit of a slog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also genuinely enjoy writing poetry. It’s fun. Writing fiction and reviews, I grate my teeth with frustration. But writing poetry, even my failures feel like victories, because I enjoy the process so much. The rules make sense to me, and I have (who knows how!) a guiding intuition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to switch things up a bit. I’m going to commit to poetry. From now on, it’s all poetry all the time. timreadsbooks is now &amp;lt;cue fanfare&amp;gt; timreadspoetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m struggling to come up with a snappy ending for this post, so I’m just gonna stop.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
