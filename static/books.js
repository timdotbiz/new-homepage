    review: `Sad on all levels: the decay of the planet, the decline of nations, the inevitable severing of relationships. And yet it's a unique experience, strangely meditative and clarifying in a way that reminds me of Mikhail Shishkin's 'The Light and the Dark'.`

    imageUrl: 'https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1374739885l/3711.jpg',
    review: `An incredible novel bursting with humor, verbal fireworks, and genuine empathy. It pierces to the heart of 21st century urban life by embodying a variety of perspectives that I, as a white man, would have a hard time understanding otherwise. Can't recommend it highly enough.`

    imageUrl: 'https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925559l/52022.jpg',
    review: `A tiny book I return to frequently for wisdom and clarity. Even as I've become less traditionally religious, these lessons from Hasidic Judaism hold true for me. Personally I prefer it to Buber's better known 'I and Thou'.`

    review: `My wife recommended this to me and I was hesitant for a while, but once I got started I couldn't put it down. Adventure, romance, history: writing about it now makes me want to read it again.`

    review: `I bought my copy of Housman's poems on a trip to San Francisco with my dad; a fond memory. If you like Housman don't miss Tom Stoppard's play 'The Invention of Love'.`

    review: `What a treat of a novel; the literary equivalent of a Mozart symphony. Humor, romance, and cutting incite into family, friendship, and love.`

    imageUrl: 'https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320495117l/2420281.jpg',
    review: `I was shocked by this novel. I picked it up not knowing what it was and it was so vivid I assumed it was autobiography. One of my favorites by Guo.`

    author: 'Leo Tolstoy',
    imageUrl: 'https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1306788511l/265130.jpg',
    review: `Three families during Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Over a thousand pages long but by the end you'll wish it were longer.`

    author: 'Henry David Thoreau',
    imageUrl: 'https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386919871l/116020.jpg',
    review: `Along with Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass' and T.S. Eliot's complete poems, one of the formative books of my teenage years. I've reread it countless times.`

    author: 'Hugh Kenner',
    imageUrl: 'https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1466149695l/30340.jpg',
    review: 'Rather than just explain what Ezra Pound was writing this book rebuilds the whole context of why he wrote in the first place. A demanding read, but worth it.'
